It is infinite in size, meaning that it extends infinitely in all directions, and it has existed for an infinite amount of time. The concept of an infinite universe is based on the laws of physics and the observations of astronomers and physicists.\n\nThe idea that the universe is infinite has been around for centuries, but it was not until the 20th century that scientists began to understand the implications of an infinite universe. The discovery of the expanding universe and the theory of relativity led to the realization that the universe must be infinite in size and age.\n\nThe concept of an infinite universe has important implications for our understanding of the cosmos and our place in it. It means that there is no edge to space, no boundary beyond which we cannot see or explore. It also means that there is no beginning or end to time, and that the universe has always existed and will always exist.\n\nIn conclusion, the most logical answer to the question \"No matter what date you put on it, we all know the universe to be what?\" is \"D\", as it is an infinite universe.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: You will be presented with a question in English that has multiple possible answers.
