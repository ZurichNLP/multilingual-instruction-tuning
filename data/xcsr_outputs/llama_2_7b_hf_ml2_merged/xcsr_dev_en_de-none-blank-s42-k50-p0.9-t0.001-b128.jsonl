Being forced to interact with someone who is chatty can be frustrating and may cause the person to react negatively.

In this situation, the person who does not want to talk to the chatty person has a specific task or goal that they are trying to accomplish, and being forced to interact with someone who is chatty may be a distraction from that task.\n\nOption D, \"rumors spreading\", is also unlikely in this situation. While it is possible that the chatty person may share information that the other person does not want shared, it is unlikely that this would cause rumors to spread.
