The other options are less likely, as they are not typically associated with police stops.\n\nThe question asks where a police officer is most likely to stop a car, and the answer is \"estación de policía\" (police station). This is the most logical answer because police stations are typically located in areas where there is a high concentration of police officers, and they are often used as bases of operations for police patrols. Police officers may also use their vehicles to patrol the streets, but they are more likely to stop cars at police stations, where they have access to resources such as radios, computers, and other equipment that can help them carry out their duties.\n\nThe other options are less likely because they do not typically involve police stops. \"El parque\" (the park) is not a common location for police stops, as it is not typically associated with law enforcement activities. \"Puerta delantera\" (front door) is also an unlikely location for a police stop, as it would be difficult for an officer to observe the driver's behavior and identify any potential violations. \"Calle\" (street) is also not a common location for police stops, as it would be difficult for an officer to observe the driver's behavior and identify any potential violations.
