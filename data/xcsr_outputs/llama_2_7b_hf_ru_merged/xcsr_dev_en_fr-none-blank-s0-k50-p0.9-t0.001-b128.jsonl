This answer does not take into account the fact that soldiers are trained to make decisions and act in the face of danger, and that they may need to use weapons to defend themselves.\n\nThe answer \"C\" is not a logical choice because it implies that soldiers simply die in battle without any attempt to fight back or defend themselves.
