The answer \"B\", \"neue Gesetze\" translates to \"new laws\" and does not provide any information about how the government can help create a changing society. The answer \"D\", \"Kulturrevolution\" translates to \"cultural revolution\" and does not provide any information about how the government can help create a changing society.
