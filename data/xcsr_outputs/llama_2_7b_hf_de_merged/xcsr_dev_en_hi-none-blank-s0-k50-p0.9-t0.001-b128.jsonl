The question asks where Jemmy will find its own path.\n\nThe answer \"B\" (\"बोटी गोश्त\") refers to the idea that Jemmy will find its own path by wandering around aimlessly. This answer does not make sense in the context of the question, as Jemmy is specifically looking for a path that it can take on its own.\n\nThe answer \"A\" (\"माइक्रोवेव\") refers to the idea that Jemmy will find its own path by using a microphone. This answer also does not make sense in the context of the question, as Jemmy is not a microphone and would not be able to use one to find its own path.\n\nThe answer \"C\" (\"बाहर\") refers to the idea that Jemmy will find its own path by going outside. This answer makes sense in the context of the question, as Jemmy is specifically looking for a path that it can take on its own and going outside would allow it to explore new areas and potentially find a new path.\n\nThe answer \"D\" (\"शयनकक्ष\") refers to the idea that Jemmy will find its own path by hiding in a corner. This answer does not make sense in the context of the question, as Jemmy is specifically looking for a path that it can take on its own and hiding in a corner would not allow it to explore new areas and potentially find a new path.\n\nThe answer \"E\" (\"पिछवाड़े\") refers to the idea that Jemmy will find its own path by going into the mountains. This answer makes sense in the context of the question, as Jemmy is specifically looking for a path that it can take on its own and going into the mountains would allow it to explore new areas and potentially find a new path.
