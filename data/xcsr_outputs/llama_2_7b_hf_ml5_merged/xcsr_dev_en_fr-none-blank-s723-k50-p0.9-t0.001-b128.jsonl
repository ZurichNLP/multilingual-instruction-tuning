This is because hair salons are where people go to get their hair styled and maintained, and it would make sense to put a hairpin there.\n\nThe other options are not as likely places to put a hairpin on a client. A tiroir d'armoire de salle de bains (bathroom closet) is not likely to be used for hair styling, and the front of a client's head is not likely to be the place where a hairpin would be used.

This suggests that the person is likely to have some connection to the Jewish community in that city. The mention of the large green torch suggests that the person may have lived in an area with a strong Jewish presence, such as a neighborhood with a large synagogue or other Jewish institution.\n\nThe mention of the person's grandparents coming from Europe in the 1940s also suggests that they may have immigrated to the city where the person worked as a cashier. This could mean that they settled in a specific neighborhood or area of the city, which may have been predominantly Jewish at that time.\n\nFinally, the mention of the person being able to see the large green torch from his room suggests that he may have lived in an area with a clear view of a landmark or symbolic structure.

This answer is not logical because competition does not necessarily create enemies, and it is possible for people to compete without having any negative feelings towards each other.\n\nThe answer \"D\" suggests that there would be winners and losers if James were in competition. This answer is logical because competition often involves winners and losers, but it does not provide any information about the consequences of being in or out of competition.\n\nThe answer \"E\" suggests that James could lose if he were in competition.
