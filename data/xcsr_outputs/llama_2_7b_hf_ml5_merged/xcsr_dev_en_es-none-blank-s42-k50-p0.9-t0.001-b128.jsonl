In chess, there is no fire involved, so this option would not be appropriate.\nC: trabajar más duro (Work harder) - This option does not make sense in the context of a chess game. In chess, the goal is to outsmart your opponent, not to work harder.\nD: defender (Defend) - This option makes sense in the context of a chess game.
