In general, the rule of thumb is to aim for an upload speed that is equal to or greater than the sum of your estimated video bitrate plus the estimated network latency for your connection.\n\nFor example, if your estimated video bitrate is 1,950 Kbps and your estimated network latency is 100 ms, you would need a minimum upload speed of around 3,050 Kbps to ensure smooth streaming and online gameplay. This means that you should aim for an upload speed of at least 3 Mbps to have a buffer of about 250 Kbps.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these estimates are only a starting point and actual requirements may vary depending on factors such as your internet service provider (ISP), the quality of your internet connection, and the type of online game you're playing. You may also want to experiment with different video bitrates and network latencies to find the optimal balance between quality and performance.\n\nIn general, if you're unsure about your upload speed requirements, it's a good idea to test your connection using a speed test tool such as Ookla Speedtest or Fast.com.

Roast the pumpkin: Place the pumpkin halves cut-side down on a baking sheet and roast for about an hour, or until the flesh is soft.\n\n4. Make the crust: Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a mixing bowl and cut in the butter with a pastry blender or two knives until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 1/4 cup cold water and mix until the dough comes together. Shape the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n\n5. Roll out the crust: Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Unwrap the dough and flatten into a circle on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out to about 12 inches across and transfer it to a pie plate. Prick the bottom crust with a fork to prevent air bubbles from forming and blind bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and fill with parchment paper and beans or pie weights to prevent the crust from shrinking during baking. Bake for another 10 minutes or until lightly browned.

Supporting local economy: By shopping at a small, locally-owned business, you are supporting the local economy and helping to keep small businesses in your community thriving. Large chain stores often have a negative impact on local economies by driving out small businesses and reducing the diversity of products and services available.\n\n2. Better customer service: Small businesses tend to provide better customer service than large chain stores. The owners and employees of small businesses are more likely to know their customers by name and to take the time to help them find what they need.\n\n3. Personalized products and services: Small businesses are often able to offer products and services that are tailored to the needs of their local community. They may carry unique or hard-to-find items that can't be found at large chain stores.\n\n4. Sustainability: Many small businesses are committed to sustainability and ethical practices, which may be important to some consumers. They may use local or sustainable materials, recycle packaging, or offer fair trade products.\n\n5. Community involvement: Small businesses are often involved in their local community and may sponsor events, donate to local causes, or support other small businesses. This sense of community can be a draw for some consumers.\n\nIn summary, shopping at a small, locally-owned business can have many benefits over shopping at a large chain store, including supporting the local economy, receiving better customer service, finding personalized products and services, prioritizing sustainability, and participating in a community.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "Why might someone prefer to shop at a small, locally-owned business instead of a large chain store, even if the prices are higher?", "secs": 1.2291343212, "source_lang": "eng_Latn", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 759, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a clear, complete, and detailed answer to the question, addressing multiple reasons why someone might prefer to shop at a small, locally-owned business instead of a large chain store.

The KH-11 had a resolution of 0.3 meters (12 inches), making it one of the highest-resolution satellites in the world at that time.

These satellites were designed to provide high-resolution imagery of areas of interest to the United States government, such as military bases, oil fields, and strategic infrastructure.\n\nThe KeyHole series of satellites was highly classified and information about their capabilities and operations was tightly controlled.

{"prompt": "### Human: What are the main methods used by car manufacturers to reduce emissions in their ICE cars besides trying to lower the amount of fuel the engine uses?### Assistant:", "system": "In addition to improving the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines (ICEs), car manufacturers also employ a variety of methods to reduce emissions:\n\n1. Exhaust Treatment: This refers to the processes and technologies used to reduce the harmful emissions that are released into the atmosphere during the combustion process. Examples include catalytic converters, diesel particulate filters, and three-way catalysts.\n\n2. Hybridization: This involves using a combination of an ICE and an electric motor to provide power to the car. Hybrid vehicles can use regenerative braking, which captures energy that would otherwise be lost during braking and stores it in the battery for later use, resulting in lower emissions overall.\n\n3. Electric Vehicles: Electric vehicles (EVs) do not rely on an internal combustion engine to power them, instead using electricity stored in batteries or other energy storage devices. They produce zero emissions when operated, making them a popular choice for environmentally conscious consumers.\n\n4. Fuel Cell Technology: Fuel cells use hydrogen as fuel, instead of gasoline or diesel, to produce electricity. They are more efficient than conventional ICEs and produce only water as an emission, making them an attractive option for reducing emissions in transportation.\n\n5. Alternative Fuels: Some car manufacturers offer vehicles that run on alternative fuels such as biofuels or natural gas, which produce fewer emissions than gasoline or diesel fuel. While these fuels may not be as widely available as conventional fuels, they can still be used in some situations to reduce emissions.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several methods that car manufacturers can employ to reduce emissions from ICE cars beyond improving fuel efficiency alone. By incorporating technologies such as exhaust treatment systems, hybridization, EVs, fuel cell technology, and alternative fuels, car manufacturers can contribute significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation sources.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "What are the main methods used by car manufacturers to reduce emissions in their ICE cars besides trying to lower the amount of fuel the engine uses?", "secs": 1.2823176682, "source_lang": "eng_Latn", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 425, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a clear and complete answer to the question by listing several methods used by car manufacturers to reduce emissions in ICE cars.

He worked as a teacher and preacher in his early adulthood, but eventually turned to painting full-time. Van Gogh's early work was heavily influenced by French Impressionism, but he eventually developed his own distinct style characterized by bold colors, expressive brushstrokes, and emotionally charged subject matter.\n\nDespite his talent and dedication to his art, Van Gogh faced numerous obstacles during his lifetime. He struggled with mental illness and financial instability, and had difficulty finding a patron or gallery to support his work. As a result, he was forced to sell his paintings for very little money or give them away.\n\nIf Van Gogh had been a successful artist during his lifetime, it's likely that his work would have been more widely recognized and appreciated. His paintings would have been displayed in galleries and museums, and he may have received more commissions for his work. Additionally, he may have earned more money from the sale of his paintings, which could have helped him support himself financially and alleviate some of the stress caused by poverty.\n\nVan Gogh's personal life was also marked by tragedy.

He had been sent by the gods to help the cats find their way back to the path of enlightenment. Spike quickly became a beloved member of the community, and he was soon joined by a curious little calico named Winkie, who had mysteriously appeared one day with no memory of her past.\n\nAs the years passed, the cats grew more and more powerful. They began to explore the outside world, discovering new lands and meeting new creatures. Some of them even gained the ability to shapeshift, taking on human form to interact with the mortals who lived below them.\n\nBut even as their powers grew, the cats remained true to their roots - they were still cats at heart. They still loved to pounce on mice and play with string, and they still enjoyed a good nap in the sun. And they remained dedicated to their mission - to help mortals find their way back to enlightenment, just like Spike had done for them so long ago.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "I'd like you to write me a story in the style of Don Delillo, about a bunch of immortal cats living in a New York high-rise co-op.

It is a simple, efficient, and versatile system that can be used to modify DNA sequences in living cells, making it a powerful tool for genetic engineering. The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two components: the Cas9 enzyme, which acts as a molecular scissors, and the guide RNA (gRNA), which directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific target sequence. The gRNA binds to the target sequence, and the Cas9 enzyme makes a double-strand break at the site of binding. This break can then be repaired by the cell's natural repair mechanisms or by introducing a new gene sequence into the target site.\n\nThe potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9 technology are vast, ranging from medical research to agriculture to environmental conservation. In medical research, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to edit genes that cause diseases, such as sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis. It can also be used to create new therapies, such as gene therapy for cancer or other genetic disorders. In agriculture, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to modify crops to make them more resistant to pests and diseases, as well as to improve yields and nutritional quality. In environmental conservation, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to modify species' genomes to make them more resistant to climate change or other environmental stressors.\n\nHowever, CRISPR-Cas9 technology also raises ethical concerns, such as the potential for genetic discrimination or for creating \"designer babies.\" It is important for researchers and policy makers to carefully consider these potential implications before moving forward with this technology.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications.", "secs": 1.4496734142, "source_lang": "eng_Latn", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 740, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a clear and complete explanation of the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, including the components of the system and how it works.

It is a statement about prime numbers and has been one of the most challenging and elusive problems in mathematics.\n\nThe theorem states that there is no solution to the equation an + bn = cn, where a, b, and c are positive integers and n is any positive integer greater than 2. In other words, given any three integers a, b, and c, if they are all prime numbers, then there is no solution to the equation an + bn = cn for any positive integer n greater than 2. This theorem was first stated by Fermat in a marginal note in one of his books, where he claimed to have found a proof that was too long to fit in the margin. He then wrote \"I have discovered a truly remarkable proof which this margin is too small to contain,\" indicating that he had found a proof but had not yet finished it.\n\nDespite Fermat's claim, no one was able to find a proof of this theorem for centuries. It wasn't until 1994 that English mathematician Andrew Wiles published a proof of FLT after more than seven years of work. Wiles's proof involved using complex numbers and other advanced mathematical techniques to show that the theorem holds true. His proof was considered groundbreaking and was hailed as one of the most significant achievements in mathematics in recent history.\n\nFLT has since become an iconic mathematical problem and is still studied by mathematicians today.

{"prompt": "### Human: How would I go about teaching my cat French?### Assistant:", "system": "Cats are known to be highly intelligent creatures and can learn various languages, including French. They can understand simple commands and actions, and over time can learn more complex commands and tricks.\n\nTo teach your cat French, it is recommended that you start with the basics and use short, simple sentences. You can also use positive reinforcement, such as treats or praise, to encourage your cat to learn.\n\nTo start, try using a toy that makes a clicking sound when it is squeezed. This sound can be used to teach your cat the French word \"click\", which means \"toy\". Hold the toy in front of your cat's face and make the clicking sound while moving the toy around. When your cat begins to associate the sound with the toy, you can gradually start using the word \"click\" in conjunction with other words, such as \"pet\" or \"play\".\n\nAnother way to teach your cat French is by using a phrase book or a language-learning app on your smartphone. You can use these resources to learn basic phrases and commands in French, such as \"bonjour\", \"oui\", and \"bon appetit\". You can then use these phrases while interacting with your cat and reward them for following your commands.\n\nIn conclusion, teaching your cat French requires patience and consistency. It is important to start with simple commands and gradually increase the complexity of your language as your cat becomes more comfortable with it. With enough practice and positive reinforcement, your cat may eventually learn how to communicate in French.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "How would I go about teaching my cat French?", "secs": 1.3974783719000001, "source_lang": "eng_Latn", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 309, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a clear and detailed answer to the question of how to teach a cat French.

{"prompt": "### Human: Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?### Assistant:", "system": "Sure! Kickball is a fun, easy-to-learn game that is popular with all ages. Here are some basic rules and strategies for playing kickball:\n\n1. Team Positions: A typical kickball team has 9 players, including a catcher, 4 outfielders, and 4 infielders. Each player has a specific position on the field, and the players change positions after every inning.\n\n2. Innings: A game of kickball is divided into innings, with each team having a chance to bat and field. The innings continue until either team reaches a predetermined number of outs (usually 3), or one team scores more runs than the other.\n\n3. Scoring: The goal of kickball is to score runs by advancing base runners to home plate. To do this, players can hit the ball with their foot (a \"kick\"), or they can be hit by a thrown ball (a \"hit\"). If a player is hit by a thrown ball, they are considered \"out\" and are removed from the game.\n\n4. Fielding: The fielding team tries to prevent the other team from scoring runs by fielding the ball and tagging out base runners. The fielding team has several defensive positions, including first base, second base, shortstop, third base, left field, center field, and right field. Players can move between defensive positions during an inning to prevent base runners from advancing to home plate.\n\n5. Rules of the Game: The rules of kickball vary slightly depending on the league or organization playing the game. Here are some common rules:\n    - A player cannot advance to first base on a walk or hit by pitch unless they are forced to leave their position on the field.\n    - A player who is tagged out while not on a base cannot return to the base they were attempting to reach until the next half-inning.\n    - If a player makes an error while fielding or throwing a ball, they cannot reenter the game until after their team has taken their next at-bat.\n    - If a player is caught stealing or attempting to steal home plate, they are considered out and must return to their previous position on the field before reentering the game.\n    - The game ends when either team reaches a predetermined number of runs (usually 10 or 15), or one team scores more runs than the other in an inning.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them.

Reusable bottles, on the other hand, can be refilled and used multiple times, reducing the amount of single-use plastic waste generated.\n\n2. Health risks: Single-use plastic bottles can leach harmful chemicals into the water they contain, which can pose health risks to both humans and wildlife. Reusable bottles do not have this risk since they are not in contact with the water they contain.\n\n3. Cost: Single-use plastic bottles are often more expensive in the long run, as they need to be replaced frequently. Reusable bottles, on the other hand, can be used for years and can save money in the long run.\n\n4. Convenience: Single-use plastic bottles are convenient for use on the go, but they can be difficult to clean and maintain over time. Reusable bottles require a bit more effort to clean and maintain, but they offer a more sustainable and convenient option in the long run.\n\nIn summary, using a reusable bottle is better for both the environment and human health compared to using single-use plastic bottles.

It is essential for the survival of all organisms on Earth, as it provides the energy necessary for maintaining cellular functions and the growth and development of the body.\n\nThe process of metabolism involves a series of steps that take place in the cells of the body. Food is broken down into smaller molecules, which are then used to create energy or to build new cells. The energy created during metabolism can be used to power various cellular processes, such as cell division, growth, and movement.\n\nMetabolism can be divided into two main categories: anabolic (building) and catabolic (breaking down). Anabolic reactions involve the creation of new molecules from smaller ones, while catabolic reactions involve breaking down larger molecules into smaller ones.\n\nExamples of anabolic reactions include protein synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, and fatty acid synthesis. Examples of catabolic reactions include glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.\n\nIn summary, metabolism is a complex process that is essential for all living organisms.

Walt had two brothers and two sisters.\n\nWalt's early life was filled with hardship and financial struggles. His family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, when he was young and then to Marceline, Missouri, where his father started a business selling newspapers and firewood. The family moved back to Chicago when Walt was still a young boy.\n\nWalt's childhood was filled with imagination and creativity. He loved to draw and write stories. He also loved to perform in front of an audience and would often put on shows for his friends and family.\n\nWalt attended McKinley High School in Chicago but dropped out in 1917 to join the military during World War I. After the war ended, Walt returned to Chicago and started working at a newspaper called The Kansas City Star. He eventually became a cartoonist for the newspaper.\n\nIn 1923, Walt moved to Hollywood, California, with his brother Roy O. Disney. They started their own animation studio called Laugh-O-Gram Studio but went bankrupt shortly afterward. Walt then worked as an animator for various studios before founding his own studio called Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio with his brother Roy in 1923. The studio produced short animated films that were distributed by various studios.\n\nIn 1928, Walt released his first feature-length animated film \"Steamboat Willie\" which featured Mickey Mouse. This film helped to establish Walt as one of the most important figures in the animation industry.\n\nIn 1937, Walt released his first full-length feature film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". This film became one of the most successful films of all time and helped to establish Walt as one of the most important figures in the film industry as well.\n\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s, Walt continued to produce successful films such as \"Pinocchio\", \"Fantasia\", \"Dumbo\", \"Bambi\", \"Cinderella\", \"Alice in Wonderland\", and many more. He also created new characters such as Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, Chip 'n Dale, etc., that have become beloved by children around the world for generations since their creation over 80 years ago!\n\nIn addition to producing films for cinema audiences worldwide over several decades (from 1928 until his death on December 15th 1966), Walt also played an instrumental role in developing theme parks including Disneyland (which opened on July 17th 1955) & Tokyo Disneyland (which opened on April 15th 1983).

Misclassification of income: This involves classifying income as something other than what it is. For example, if a person works as a consultant but is paid a salary and benefits by a company, they could misclassify their income as a consultant and avoid paying self-employment taxes.\n\n5. Off-the-books income: This involves earning income outside of the formal economy, such as cash payments for services rendered or under-the-table payments for goods sold. This can be difficult to track and can result in tax evasion if the income is not reported on a tax return.\n\n6.

In the following sections, we will explore how these factors can influence people's food choices and how this knowledge can be used to promote healthier diets.\n\n1. Cultural Factors: Culture can shape people's food choices and preferences in a variety of ways. For example, some cultures place a strong emphasis on the importance of eating certain foods, such as traditional dishes or foods that are believed to have medicinal or spiritual benefits. These cultural beliefs can influence people's food choices and lead to patterns of dietary intake that may not align with recommended guidelines for healthy eating.\n\n2. Social Factors: Social factors, such as peer pressure and social norms, can also influence people's food choices and diets. For example, if a person lives in an area where fast food is readily available and considered socially acceptable, they may be more likely to eat unhealthy foods on a regular basis. Similarly, if a person is part of a group or community that values healthy eating, they may be more likely to make healthier choices.\n\n3. Economic Factors: Economic factors, such as income, access to healthy food options, and food prices, can also influence people's food choices and diets. For example, if a person lives in an area with limited access to fresh produce or healthy food options, they may be more likely to eat unhealthy foods that are more readily available and affordable. Conversely, if a person has higher income and access to healthy food options, they may be more likely to make healthier choices.\n\nBy understanding how cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices and diets, we can develop targeted interventions that promote healthier eating habits. For example, promoting cultural pride in traditional dishes while also educating people about the importance of a balanced diet could help promote healthier eating habits in certain communities. Similarly, creating initiatives that increase access to fresh produce in low-income areas could help improve dietary intake in these communities.\n\nIn conclusion, cultural, social, and economic factors play a significant role in shaping people's food choices and influencing their diets. By understanding how these factors influence people's eating habits, we can develop targeted interventions that promote healthier eating habits and improve overall public health outcomes.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can this knowledge be used to promote healthier diets?", "secs": 1.4496734142, "source_lang": "eng_Latn", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 743, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a clear and complete answer to the task question, addressing how cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices and how this knowledge can be used to promote healthier diets.

It also implies that our actions can have an impact on other universes, which can be difficult to accept.\n\nAnother reason why many people don't like the many-worlds interpretation is because it seems to undermine the concept of causality. In the many-worlds interpretation, every decision we make is not necessarily determined by previous events or actions, but rather it can be influenced by random factors or quantum fluctuations. This can make it difficult to understand how events are related or how they occur in a linear fashion.\n\nFinally, some people find the idea of an infinite number of parallel universes to be too complicated or impractical.

For example, if two people do not speak the same language, they may struggle to understand each other's thoughts and feelings, making it more difficult to form a close connection.\n\nCultural Barriers:\nCultural barriers can also play a role in communication and relationship-building in multicultural societies. Cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, making it more difficult for people from different backgrounds to connect on a deeper level.\n\nFor example, in some cultures, it is considered impolite to directly express disagreement or criticism towards others, while in other cultures, this is expected and even encouraged. These differences can make it challenging for people from different cultures to communicate effectively with one another.\n\nSolutions:\nTo overcome language and cultural barriers in multicultural societies, it is important for people to learn about each other's cultures and languages. This can be done through formal language classes, cultural workshops, or even simply by interacting with others from different backgrounds. Additionally, it is important for people to be patient and understanding of the challenges that others may face due to language or cultural differences.\n\nUltimately, overcoming language and cultural barriers requires empathy, patience, and a willingness to learn from one another.

However, his seizure of absolute power took place in 1935, when he dissolved the Reichstag, the German parliament, and suspended civil liberties.\n\nThe events that led up to Hitler's absolute power in 1935 began with the Reichstag fire, a suspicious fire that broke out in the German parliament building on February 27, 1933. The fire was blamed on a Dutch communist named Marinus van der Lubbe, who was convicted of the crime and executed. The incident provided Hitler with an excuse to enact repressive measures against the communist party and other political opponents.\n\nIn March 1933, Hitler passed the Enabling Act, which gave him dictatorial powers to enact laws without the approval of the Reichstag. This act effectively suspended civil liberties and allowed Hitler to rule by decree. In April 1933, he signed the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which purged civil servants who were considered politically unreliable.\n\nIn July 1934, Hitler appointed himself as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, which effectively put him in control of all military forces in Germany. In August 1934, he appointed himself as Führer and Reich Chancellor, which gave him absolute power over all political and economic affairs in Germany.\n\nIn February 1935, Hitler dissolved the Reichstag and suspended civil liberties indefinitely. He also enacted emergency decrees that gave him unlimited powers to rule by decree. This effectively ended democracy in Germany and established a dictatorship under Adolf Hitler.\n\nHitler's seizure of absolute power in 1935 was a gradual process that began with his rise to power in 1933 and culminated in his absolute control over all political and economic affairs in Germany by 1935.

Easy to develop and debug: Interpreted languages, like Python and JavaScript, are generally easy to develop and debug because the code is translated to machine language at runtime.\n2. Faster development time: Interpreted languages can be written quickly and easily, which can save time during the development process.\n3. Higher level of abstraction: Interpreted languages allow developers to write code at a higher level of abstraction, which can make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n4. More flexibility: Interpreted languages are more flexible than compiled languages because they can be changed or modified more easily. This allows developers to quickly adapt to changes in requirements or technology.\n\nCompiled:\n1. Faster performance: Compiled languages, like C++ and Java, are generally faster than interpreted languages because the code is compiled to machine language before execution.\n2. Better memory usage: Compiled languages can use memory more efficiently than interpreted languages because the code is compiled before execution.\n3. Better optimization: Compiled languages are better suited for optimization because the code is already compiled before execution, so it can be optimized more effectively.\n4.

Introduction (5 minutes): Introduce the topic of friendship and its importance in our lives. Ask students what they know about friendship and what it means to them. Review the language functions of describing friendships and explaining actions.\n2. Guided Discussion (15 minutes): Divide the class into pairs and ask each pair to discuss their first friendships. Prompt them with questions such as \"When did you first meet your first friend?\" and \"What was your first friendship like?\" Record their answers on the board or a flip chart. Encourage students to use language functions such as describing, explaining, and giving reasons for actions. As students share their experiences, write down their examples on the board or flip chart. Encourage students to use language functions such as agreeing or disagreeing with others' views or suggestions. When students have finished, have them share their experiences with the rest of the class. Encourage students to ask clarifying questions or make comments to help their classmates expand on their answers. Write down any new examples on the board or flip chart. This activity will help students develop their speaking skills in describing friendships and exchanging information and invitations. 3. Practice (10 minutes): Divide the class into pairs again and ask them to practice using language functions by taking turns describing a friend they remember from their childhood or adolescence. Encourage students to use language functions such as describing, explaining, and giving reasons for actions in their descriptions. After a few minutes of practice, ask each pair to share their descriptions with the rest of the class. Encourage students to ask clarifying questions or make comments to help their classmates expand on their answers. Write down any new examples on the board or flip chart.

Summary (5 minutes): Review the key language functions covered in this lesson, such as describing, explaining, and giving reasons for actions, and inviting others to do something together or engage in an activity with you. Encourage students to reflect on how they used these functions during the lesson and how they might apply them in future conversations about friendship. This will help reinforce the key concepts covered in this lesson plan while also preparing students for future speaking activities related to friendship. 5. Homework (30 minutes): Assign students a short writing assignment about a friend they had in childhood or adolescence that had an impact on their life today (either positive or negative). Encourage them to use language functions such as describing, explaining, and giving reasons for actions in their descriptions of that friend's impact on their life today (either positive or negative).
