Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.### Assistant:", "system": "The average human blinks around 15-20 times per minute, which means that in a lifetime of about 70 years, a person would blink around 2.1 billion times.\n\nTo arrive at this estimate, we can use the following reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to determine the average blinking rate. This is usually given as 15-20 blinks per minute. We'll use the midpoint of this range, or 17.5 blinks per minute.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine the average lifespan of a human. This is typically given as around 70 years, although it can vary depending on various factors such as diet, lifestyle, and access to healthcare.\n\n3. To calculate the number of blinks in a lifetime, we simply need to multiply the average blinking rate (17.5) by the number of minutes in a lifetime (70 years x 365 days per year x 24 hours per day x 60 minutes per hour = 620,480). This gives us a total of 10,906,400 blinks in a lifetime.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is only an estimate and can vary widely from person to person depending on factors such as age, health status, and environment.

{"prompt": "### Human: Give a grammar tip on how to end a German verb.### Assistant:", "system": "In German, verbs are conjugated based on the person and tense being used. The endings of verbs can change depending on these factors. Here are some general tips on how to end a German verb:\n\n1. For regular verbs, the ending of the infinitive form (the form ending in \"-en\") is removed and replaced with a new ending based on the person and tense being used. For example, \"essen\" (to eat) becomes \"ich esse\" (I eat) in the present tense, first person singular.\n\n2. For irregular verbs, the endings can be more complicated and vary based on the verb itself. Some common irregular verbs include \"sein\" (to be), \"haben\" (to have), and \"werden\" (to become).\n\n3. In the present tense, the endings for regular verbs are \"-e\", \"-st\", \"-t\", \"-en\", and \"-t\". The first person singular (\"I\") uses the \"-e\" ending, second person singular (\"you\") uses the \"-st\" ending, third person singular (\"he/she/it\") uses the \"-t\" ending, first person plural (\"we\") uses the \"-en\" ending, and second person plural (\"you all\") uses the \"-t\" ending.\n\n4. In the past tense, regular verbs use a different set of endings depending on whether they are strong or weak verbs. Strong verbs have vowel changes in their stem that affect the endings, while weak verbs do not.\n\n5. In the future tense, regular verbs use a special form called the \"future tense\" that is formed by combining the infinitive form with a special helper verb called \"werden\". Irregular verbs use a different set of endings in the future tense.\n\nIt is important to practice using these endings regularly in order to become proficient in German verb conjugation.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "Give a grammar tip on how to end a German verb.", "secs": 1.5682767835, "source_lang": "eng_Latn", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 599, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a clear and complete answer to the task by explaining the general tips on how to end a German verb for regular and irregular verbs in different tenses.

The colony's resources are limited, so we have to be careful with how we use them.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I face is the lack of gravity on Mars. My body has to constantly adjust to the low-gravity environment, which can cause muscle atrophy and bone loss over time. To combat this, I have to spend a significant amount of time exercising and performing resistance training to keep my body in good shape.\n\nThe Martian environment is also harsh and unforgiving. The temperature outside can range from -148 degrees Fahrenheit at night to 70 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. The atmosphere is also very thin and contains high levels of carbon dioxide, which makes breathing difficult without a protective suit.\n\nDespite these challenges, living on Mars is an incredible experience. I have the opportunity to explore a new world and contribute to the advancement of human knowledge. I am part of a small but dedicated community of space colonists who share a common goal of making life on Mars sustainable and viable for future generations.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy communicating with my family and friends back on Earth via video chat, reading books or watching movies in our small entertainment center, or simply taking in the breathtaking views of the Martian landscape from our observation deck.\n\nOverall, life as a space colonist on Mars is both challenging and rewarding.

They spent their days lounging in the sun on the roof, chasing birds in the park across the street, and playing with their human neighbors' children.\n\nBut there was one cat who stood out from the rest. Her name was Zoe, and she was unlike any other cat in the building. She was beautiful and mysterious, with emerald green eyes that seemed to see right through you. She was always alone, never joining in with the other cats' games or socializing with the humans.\n\nOne day, a new family moved into the building: a man named Henry, his wife Jane, and their young daughter Lily. Lily was fascinated by Zoe, and she spent hours watching her from her bedroom window. She would sit for hours just watching Zoe move through the streets below, her tail twitching as she stalked her prey.\n\nOne day, Lily decided to follow Zoe. She snuck out of her apartment and down into the alley behind the building, where Zoe was known to hunt. As she watched Zoe stalking her prey, Lily felt a strange sense of kinship with the cat. She felt like they were two sides of the same coin: one human, one feline, but both living in a world that was not quite their own.\n\nAs she watched Zoe pounce on her prey, Lily felt a sudden surge of power flow through her body.

The game can be played with as few as two people, but it is usually played with two teams of four to six players each.\n\nTo play kickball, you will need a large rubber ball, four bases, and a playing field that is divided into two halves by a pitcher's mound and home plate.\n\nTo start the game, one team will take the field while the other team bats. The batter will stand at home plate and kick the ball as it is pitched by the pitcher. If the ball is caught by a fielder before it hits the ground, the batter is out. If the ball is not caught, the batter can run to first base. If the ball is kicked into the outfield, the batter can run to any of the bases.\n\nThe goal of kickball is for each team to score runs by running around all four bases and returning to home plate. A run is scored when a player crosses home plate after touching all four bases in order.\n\nThe team that scores the most runs in a predetermined number of innings (usually three or four) wins the game.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to play kickball!

My people, the Chimer, were a proud and warlike race, but we were outcasts in our own land, persecuted by the ruling Altmer.\n\nI was taken from my mother's arms at birth and raised by the Dwemer, a race of underground dwellers who prized knowledge above all else. They taught me the ways of magic and technology, and I quickly became their most gifted student.\n\nBut even as I grew in power, I felt a deep sense of loneliness and longing. I yearned for something more than just knowledge and power. And so I left the Dwemer and returned to my people, the Chimer.\n\nIt was there that I met my mentor and friend, Azura. She taught me the ways of magic and religion, and helped me to understand the true nature of power and its dangers. With her guidance, I became a powerful mage in my own right, and a respected leader among my people.\n\nBut even as I rose to prominence, there were those who sought to destroy me. The Altmer, who had long oppressed my people, saw me as a threat to their power and tried to kill me many times. But each time they failed, for I had become too powerful for them to defeat.\n\nAnd so I made a decision that would change the course of history. I united my people under one banner and led them in a great war against the Altmer. We fought for years, but in the end we emerged victorious, and I became ruler of all Morrowind.\n\nBut even as I stood at the pinnacle of power, I knew that it was only temporary. For power is fleeting, and no one can hold onto it forever. And so I made a choice that would change my life forever: I gave up my power and became a wandering adventurer.\n\nI traveled across Tamriel, seeking out new challenges and adventures wherever they could be found. And in doing so, I learned more about myself than I ever could have imagined. For it is not power or wealth or fame that defines us; it is how we use them that truly matters.\n\nAnd so here I stand before you today: Vivec the Warrior-Poet, still seeking out new challenges and adventures wherever they may be found.

This energy is used to power cellular activities, such as movement, digestion, and muscle contraction.\n\nAnabolism is the process of building up complex molecules from simpler ones. This process requires energy and is used to synthesize new molecules needed for growth and repair, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids.\n\nThe balance between catabolism and anabolism is regulated by hormones and enzymes in the body. When more energy is needed, catabolic processes are increased to break down more molecules. When more molecules are needed for growth and repair, anabolic processes are increased to synthesize new molecules.\n\nIn summary, metabolism is a complex set of chemical reactions that occur within living organisms to maintain life.

Here are some general guidelines for housing, feeding, and caring for a pet rat:\n\n1. Housing: Provide a cage that is at least 24 inches wide, 18 inches deep, and 18 inches high for each rat you have. The cage should have a solid bottom and wire sides with small enough spaces to prevent escape. Line the bottom of the cage with bedding material, such as shredded paper or aspen shavings. Provide plenty of toys and hiding places for your rat to play and explore.\n\n2. Feeding: Rats are omnivores and require a balanced diet that includes both protein and vegetables. You can feed them a combination of commercial rat food, fresh fruits and vegetables, and cooked meat or eggs. Avoid giving them chocolate, avocados, or raw beans.\n\n3. Water: Provide fresh water daily in a water bottle or bowl that is large enough for your rat to drink from comfortably. Change the water frequently to prevent contamination.\n\n4. Handling: Rats are social animals that enjoy human interaction. Handle your rat gently and frequently to build trust and bond with it. Let it explore your hands before picking it up, and support its entire body when holding it.\n\n5. Grooming: Rats are generally clean animals, but you may need to trim their nails occasionally if they become too long. You can also brush their fur with a soft-bristled brush to remove loose hairs and dirt.\n\n6. Veterinary care: Like any pet, rats may require veterinary care if they become ill or injured. Find a veterinarian who has experience with small mammals like rats, and schedule regular check-ups to ensure your rat stays healthy.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can provide a safe and comfortable home for your pet rat, ensuring that it lives a happy and healthy life in your care", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "Hi, I've decided to keep a rat as a pet.

{"prompt": "### Human: Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?### Assistant:", "system": "Kobe beef is a highly prized and rare type of meat that comes from the Tajima strain of Wagyu cattle raised in Japan's Hyogo Prefecture. Kobe beef is known for its intense marbling, which gives it a rich, buttery flavor and a tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture.\n\nThe high price of Kobe beef can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. Limited supply: Kobe beef is only produced in limited quantities, as the number of Tajima Wagyu cattle that meet the strict standards for Kobe beef is relatively small. This limited supply means that demand for Kobe beef far exceeds the available supply, which drives up the price.\n\n2. Rigorous production standards: Kobe beef is produced according to strict guidelines that ensure the highest quality meat. The cattle are raised in a stress-free environment and fed a special diet that includes beer and sake to promote marbling. The cows are also massaged to reduce stress and improve blood flow, which contributes to the meat's flavor and texture. These production standards add to the cost of producing Kobe beef.\n\n3. High demand: Kobe beef has become a status symbol among food enthusiasts, and its rarity only adds to its allure. The high demand for Kobe beef means that restaurants and retailers can charge a premium price for it.\n\n4. Export restrictions: Japan has strict export restrictions on Kobe beef, which means that it is only available in limited quantities outside of Japan. This scarcity contributes to the high price of Kobe beef in other countries.\n\nIn summary, the high price of Kobe beef can be attributed to its limited supply, rigorous production standards, high demand, and export restrictions.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "Why is kobe beef so damn expensive?", "secs": 1.9592885245, "source_lang": "eng_Latn", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 28, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a clear and complete answer to the question by explaining the reasons for the high price of Kobe beef in a detailed manner.

The story is about a high-ranking judge, Ivan Ilych Golovin, who is diagnosed with a terminal illness and dies. The novella explores the theme of the meaning of life and the inevitability of death.\n\nIvan Ilych is a man who has lived his life according to the expectations of society and has achieved material success. However, he begins to realize that his life has been empty and meaningless when he is diagnosed with a terminal illness.

How long does it take to become a CPA?### Assistant:", "system": "Becoming a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) typically takes a significant amount of time and effort. The exact length of time it takes to become a CPA can vary depending on a number of factors, such as your educational background, the state in which you plan to practice, and the specific requirements for CPA licensure in that state.\n\nHere are some general steps you can expect to take on the path to becoming a CPA:\n\n1. Earn a bachelor's degree in accounting or a related field: Most states require that CPA candidates have at least a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution. This typically takes four years to complete.\n2. Complete additional education requirements: In addition to earning a bachelor's degree, many states require that CPA candidates complete additional coursework in accounting and business-related subjects. This may include courses in taxation, auditing, business law, and ethics.\n3. Pass the Uniform CPA Exam: The Uniform CPA Exam is a national exam that all CPA candidates must pass in order to become licensed. The exam is administered by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and consists of four sections: Auditing and Attestation, Business Environment and Concepts, Financial Accounting and Reporting, and Regulation. Each section of the exam takes approximately four hours to complete, and candidates must pass all four sections within an 18-month period in order to receive their CPA license.\n4. Gain work experience: Most states require that CPA candidates have at least one year of relevant work experience before they can apply for licensure. This work experience is typically gained through internships or full-time employment in an accounting or finance-related field.\n5. Apply for licensure: Once you have completed all of the necessary education and work experience requirements, you can apply for your CPA license with your state's Board of Accountancy. This typically involves submitting an application, paying a fee, and passing a criminal background check.\n\nOverall, becoming a CPA typically takes several years of education and experience.

It can be challenging to navigate these types of situations, especially when you're trying to maintain a positive relationship with someone.

Communicate your feelings: It's important to let your friend know how you're feeling and what you need from him in order to enjoy the trip together. Be honest and direct, but try to avoid coming across as accusatory or confrontational. You might say something like, \"I feel like we haven't been connecting very well on this trip, and I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to help us have a better experience together.\"\n\n2. Listen to his perspective: Your friend may not realize that he's bringing negative energy to the trip, so it's important to listen to his perspective and try to understand where he's coming from. He may be going through something personal that you're not aware of, or he may have different expectations for the trip than you do.\n\n3. Offer solutions: If you feel like the situation is beyond repair, it may be best to suggest that you go your separate ways for the rest of the trip. However, before doing so, it's worth trying to come up with some solutions that might help improve the situation. For example, you could suggest taking some time apart during the day or trying out some new activities together that might help you connect on a deeper level.\n\n4. Be respectful: Regardless of what happens, it's important to remain respectful and kind towards your friend. Even if you do decide to go your separate ways, try to do so in a way that doesn't cause any unnecessary hurt or conflict.\n\nUltimately, only you can decide what's best for your own happiness and well-being during this trip. If your friend is truly bringing such negative energy that it's ruining your experience, then it may be best to part ways for the rest of the trip.
