In this case we say about city county or powiat grodzki. Such cities are for example Lublin, Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań. In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of powiat's entitlements – like already mentioned car registration. For example, the district Wola has its own evidence and the district Ursynów – its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from Ursynów).

The term \"Tulku\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"Tulpa\", which means \"emanation\". In Tibetan Buddhism, a Tulku is considered to be an emanation of a Buddha or Bodhisattva, and is believed to possess the same qualities and abilities as the original.\n\nThe term \"Tulku\" is used to refer to both male and female teachers in Tibetan Buddhism, and can be used interchangeably with the term \"Lama\". However, the term \"Lama\" is more commonly used to refer to a teacher who has not been reincarnated, while the term \"Tulku\" is used to refer to a teacher who has been reincarnated many times.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, a Tulku is considered to be an emanation of a Buddha or Bodhisattva, and is believed to possess the same qualities and abilities as the original. This belief is based on the belief that a Tulku's mind has been purified through their previous lives, and that they have developed a strong connection with their spiritual teacher. This connection allows them to access the wisdom and knowledge of their previous lives, and use it to benefit others.\n\nIn addition to being considered an emanation of a Buddha or Bodhisattva, a Tulku is also considered to be an incarnation of a deity. This deity can be either male or female, depending on the gender of the previous incarnation. For example, if the previous incarnation was male, then the current incarnation will be female. Similarly, if the previous incarnation was female, then the current incarnation will be male.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, it is believed that a Tulku's mind has been purified through their previous lives, and that they have developed a strong connection with their spiritual teacher.

In On the Abrogation of the Private Mass, he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice, asserting instead that it is a gift, to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation. His essay On Confession, Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution, since \"every Christian is a confessor.\" In November, Luther wrote The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows.

The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them.

He was the grandson of Frederick I, the founder of the House of Hohenzollern, and the great-grandson of Frederick V, Elector of Brandenburg.\n\nFrederick William was a devout Lutheran and a staunch opponent of Calvinism, which was practiced by many Huguenots. However, he invited Huguenot immigration to his lands in order to strengthen his military and cultural influence.\n\nThe Elector's invitation to Huguenots was a significant event in European history, as it marked the beginning of a new era in which religious tolerance became a central tenet of European culture.

He was born in 1819 in the town of Schwerin, which was then part of the Kingdom of Prussia. His father was a Protestant pastor and his mother was a Huguenot.\n\nFontane's family moved to Berlin in 1825, where he attended school and studied literature. He became interested in writing poetry at an early age and published his first poem, \"Die Nachtigall\" (The Nightingale), when he was only 14 years old.\n\nIn 1838, Fontane's family moved to Hamburg, where he continued his studies and began to write poetry and short stories. He also worked as a journalist and critic for several newspapers.\n\nIn 1842, Fontane moved to Berlin to study law at the University of Berlin. However, he soon realized that he had no interest in pursuing a career in law and instead focused on writing poetry and fiction.\n\nIn 1846, Fontane published his first novel, \"Der alte und der junge Bock\" (The Old and the Young Ox), which was well received by critics and readers alike. The novel is set in the countryside of Brandenburg and tells the story of two brothers who struggle to make ends meet during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nIn 1851, Fontane published his second novel, \"Der arme Heinrich\" (The Poor Heinrich), which is considered to be one of his best works. The novel is set in the Prussian countryside and follows the life of a young man named Heinrich who struggles to find work and make ends meet.\n\nIn 1853, Fontane published his third novel, \"Der arme Heinrich II\" (The Poor Heinrich II), which is considered to be a sequel to his first novel. The novel follows Heinrich as he continues to struggle with poverty and unemployment.\n\nIn 1854, Fontane published his fourth novel, \"Der arme Heinrich III\" (The Poor Heinrich III), which is considered to be a continuation of the previous two novels. The novel follows Heinrich as he continues to struggle with poverty and unemployment.\n\nIn 1855, Fontane published his fifth novel, \"Der arme Heinrich IV\" (The Poor Heinrich IV), which is considered to be a conclusion to the previous three novels. The novel follows Heinrich as he finally finds work and begins to make ends meet.\n\nIn addition to his novels, Fontane also wrote several plays, including \"Die Sturmflut\" (The Storm Flood) and \"Die Sturmflut II\" (The Storm Flood II). He also wrote several short stories and poems, including the famous poem \"Der alte und der junge Bock\".\n\nOverall, Theodor Fontane was a prolific writer who wrote about the struggles of everyday people in Germany during the nineteenth century.

He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds for his service during the war. After the war, Galland continued to serve in the German Air Force, eventually retiring as a general in 1966.\n\nGalland's Huguenot ancestry is an important part of his legacy as a military leader and pilot.

Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence.\n\nPassage:\n\nA steam turbine consists of one or more rotors (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of stators (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing. The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is another term for rotors?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

The ratio is determined by measuring the amount of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in a sample, which is typically done by analyzing the ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms.\n\nThe ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in seawater is determined by the temperature and pressure of the water. During periods of lower global temperatures, more oxygen-16 is incorporated into the seawater, resulting in a higher ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16.\n\nThe ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in ice core samples is determined by the temperature and pressure of the air at the time the ice was formed. During periods of lower global temperatures, more oxygen-16 is incorporated into the ice, resulting in a higher ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16.\n\nThe ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in a sample can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n(Oxygen-18/Oxygen-16)sample = (Oxygen-18/Oxygen-16)standard * (Oxygen-18/Oxygen-16)standard + (Oxygen-16/Oxygen-18)standard * (Oxygen-16/Oxygen-18)standard\n\nwhere Oxygen-18/Oxygen-16 is the ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in the sample, Oxygen-18/Oxygen-16 standard is the ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in a standard sample, and Oxygen-16/Oxygen-18 standard is the ratio of oxygen-16 to oxygen-18 in a standard sample.\n\nBased on this equation, we can calculate that the ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in a sample is about 2.4% heavier than that in a standard sample.

This is the date of the surprise attack on Israel by Syria and Egypt, which was launched during the Yom Kippur War.\n\nThe Yom Kippur War was a conflict between Israel and several Arab nations, including Syria and Egypt, that took place from October 6 to October 25, 1973. The war began when Israel launched a surprise attack on Egypt and Syria, which were both involved in the conflict. The surprise attack was intended to destroy the Egyptian and Syrian armies before they could reinforce each other. However, the attack was unsuccessful, and Israel was forced to withdraw from Egyptian and Syrian territory.\n\nThe Yom Kippur War had a significant impact on the global economy, as it released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices. At the time, Iran was the world's second-largest oil exporter and a close US ally. However, weeks after the war ended, Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi said in an interview: \"Of course [the price of oil] is going to rise... Certainly! And how!...

The embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies, even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic. Finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow long does it take for new areas to have significant oil production?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999).

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhen did the first direct elections take place?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU.

The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU.

The two regulations that conflicted with the Italian law in the Simmenthal SpA case were the 1964 and 1968 regulations. These regulations were issued by the European Commission and were directly applicable to all member states. They were intended to regulate the importation of beef from France to Italy. The Italian law in question was a national law that prohibited the importation of beef from France. The two regulations were intended to override the Italian law and allow for the importation of beef from France. However, the Italian law was still in force at the time of the Simmenthal SpA case, and it was not until 1970 that the Italian law was repealed. Therefore, the two regulations that conflicted with the Italian law in the Simmenthal SpA case were the 1964 and 1968 regulations.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

Carbon is a type of chemical element that is found in many natural and man-made materials, including fossil fuels, plastics, and wood. Carbon is released into the atmosphere when these materials are burned or decompose.\n\nThe Amazon region is a large area of tropical rainforest that covers parts of nine countries in South America. The rainforest is home to a wide variety of plants and animals, including many species that are unique to the region. The rainforest also plays an important role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in its vegetation.\n\nThe release of carbon from the Amazon region could accelerate global warming, which could have serious consequences for the environment and human society. Global warming is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which trap heat from the Sun and prevent it from escaping into space. Carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse gases, and its release into the atmosphere could lead to increased temperatures, rising sea levels, and other changes that could affect ecosystems and human societies.\n\nIn conclusion, environmentalists are concerned about the release of carbon from the Amazon region because it could accelerate global warming and have serious consequences for the environment and human society.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead. Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat do some researchers believe is the earliest-diverging animal phylum is?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

Population growth and traffic congestion in cities along SR 99: As the population of cities along SR 99 has grown, so has the traffic congestion on the road. This has led to a desire for improvements to the road to make it more efficient and less congested.\n\n2. The desirability of Federal funding: The Federal government provides funding for many infrastructure projects, including interstate highways. As SR 99 is not currently an interstate highway, there is a desire to upgrade it to interstate standards in order to qualify for Federal funding.\n\n3. The desire for improved safety and efficiency: Many people believe that upgrading SR 99 to interstate standards will improve safety and efficiency on the road. This is because interstate highways are designed with specific standards and regulations that are not always followed on non-interstate highways. Upgrading SR 99 would ensure that it meets these standards and regulations, which would improve safety and efficiency on the road.\n\nIn conclusion, the factors contributing to the desire to have SR 99 improved to be of interstate standards include population growth and traffic congestion in cities along SR 99, the desirability of Federal funding, and the desire for improved safety and efficiency.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

Before the introduction of X.25 in 1973, about twenty different network technologies had been developed. Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core. In the datagram system, the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is an example of a datagram protocol. In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host. This results in a simpler host interface with less functionality than in the datagram model.

The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–25, and again in 1635–36, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679.

The plague outbreak in Paris in 1466 is estimated to have killed 40,000 people. This is based on the fact that the Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, and 1636, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623–25, and again in 1635–36, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348–50.

Jamukha supported the traditional Mongolian aristocracy, while Temüjin followed a meritocratic method, and attracted a broader, though lower class, range of followers. Due to his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the shaman Kokochu that the Eternal Blue Sky had set aside the world for Temüjin, Temüjin began rising to power. In 1186, Temüjin was elected khan of the Mongols. However, Jamukha, threatened by Temüjin's rapid ascent, quickly moved to stop Temüjin's ambitions. In 1187, he launched an attack against his former friend with an army of thirty thousand troops. Temüjin hastily gathered together his followers to defend against the attack, but he was decisively beaten in the Battle of Dalan Balzhut.

Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering.

Immunology is the study of the immune system, which is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that protects the body from infection and disease. The immune system is made up of white blood cells, such as lymphocytes and macrophages, that recognize and destroy foreign substances or pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells. It also produces antibodies that bind to specific antigens to neutralize them.\n\nImmunology is a broad field that encompasses many different aspects of the immune system, including its development, function, and regulation.

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a condition that results from the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV attacks the immune system, which is responsible for protecting the body from infections and diseases. As a result, people with AIDS have a weakened immune system and are at increased risk of developing various infections and diseases.\n\nThe acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a serious condition that can lead to death if left untreated. It is important to note that AIDS is not the same as HIV infection, which is the stage before AIDS. People with HIV infection may not develop AIDS for many years or even decades, depending on their immune system's ability to fight off the virus. However, once someone develops AIDS, they are at risk of developing various infections and diseases that can be life-threatening.\n\nIt is important to note that AIDS is not the only condition that results in immunodeficiency in humans. Other conditions that can lead to immunodeficiency include:\n\n- Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): This is a rare genetic disorder that results in a complete lack of T and B cells, which are essential for the immune system to function properly.\n\n- Acquired hypogammaglobulinemia: This condition results in a decreased number of antibodies in the blood, which can make it difficult for the body to fight off infections.\n\n- Autoimmune diseases: These conditions occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues as if they were foreign invaders. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n- Immunodeficiency disorders: These disorders result from a genetic defect or an acquired condition that impairs the immune system's ability to function properly. Common immunodeficiency disorders include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, common variable immunodeficiency, and X-linked agammaglobulinemia.\n\nIn summary, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a serious condition that results from the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The parasite uses antigenic variation to evade the immune system and avoid detection by the host.\n\nTrypanosoma brucei has a complex life cycle that involves two different types of cells: procyclic and epimastigote. Procyclic cells are the infective form of the parasite, while epimastigotes are the non-infective form. During the procyclic stage, the parasite produces large numbers of procyclic trypomastigotes, which are released into the bloodstream and invade host cells.

During the procyclic stage, trypanosomes express a variety of surface proteins on their outer membrane. These proteins are constantly changing, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize them as \"non-self\" structures. During the epimastigote stage, trypanosomes express a different set of surface proteins, which are not recognized by the immune system as \"self\" structures.

The poem was written in response to the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, which occurred in Manchester, England. The massacre was a violent protest against the government's refusal to reform the electoral system. Shelley's poem imagines a new form of social action that would be nonviolent and peaceful.\n\nThe poem begins with the images of what Shelley thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action. Shelley writes:\n\n\"The mask of Anarchy is fallen, and the face of Anarchy is Man.\"\n\nThis line suggests that the mask of Anarchy has fallen, revealing the face of Anarchy to be Man. Shelley then imagines a new form of social action that would be nonviolent and peaceful. He writes:\n\n\"The voice of Anarchy is the voice of Man.\"\n\nThis line suggests that the voice of Anarchy is the voice of Man, and that it is a voice for change and reform.

It has been claimed that the Hungarians under Ferenc Deák directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government. Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing \"peaceable revolution.\" Howard Zinn, Harvey Wheeler, and others have identified the right espoused in The Declaration of Independence to \"alter or abolish\" an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat famous Indian's actions were considered civil disobedience?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

During the 1950s and 1960s, many white Americans moved to the suburbs in search of better schools, safer neighborhoods, and more affordable housing. This led to a significant decline in the population of many cities, particularly those with large African American populations.\n\nThe term \"white flight\" was coined by sociologist William H. Whyte in his book The Organization Man, which was published in 1958. In the book, Whyte describes how white Americans moved to the suburbs in search of a better life, leaving behind their urban communities and their African American neighbors. He argues that this process had a negative impact on urban areas, leading to a decline in economic activity and social cohesion.\n\nWhile white flight has been a significant factor in the decline of many American cities, it is important to note that it is not the only factor contributing to urban decay. Other factors such as economic decline, poor public services, and crime can also play a role. However, white flight has been one of the most significant drivers of urban decay and racial segregation in the United States.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871; however, Jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area. The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds. The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph (180 km/h), making it a strong Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008's Tropical Storm Fay which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days. Similarly, four years prior to this, Jacksonville was inundated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which made landfall south of the area.

Inequality reduces aggregate demand by reducing consumption and investment. When people have less money to spend, they tend to consume less and invest less, which reduces aggregate demand.\n\n2. Inequality reduces aggregate demand by reducing labor supply. When people have less money to spend, they may choose to work less, which also reduces aggregate demand.\n\n3. Inequality reduces aggregate demand by reducing the ability of governments to spend on public goods and services. When people have less money to spend, governments may not be able to provide the public goods and services that are necessary for economic growth, such as education, infrastructure, and health care.\n\n4. Inequality reduces aggregate demand by reducing the ability of businesses to invest in productive capital. When people have less money to spend, businesses may not be able to invest in productive capital, such as machinery and equipment, which would increase their productivity and output.\n\n5. Inequality reduces aggregate demand by reducing the ability of households to save and invest. When people have less money to spend, they may choose to save more or invest less, which would reduce aggregate demand even further.\n\n6. Inequality reduces aggregate demand by reducing the ability of households to consume imported goods and services. When people have less money to spend, they may choose to consume fewer imported goods and services, which would reduce aggregate demand even further.\n\n7. Inequality reduces aggregate demand by reducing the ability of households to consume domestically produced goods and services. When people have less money to spend, they may choose to consume fewer domestically produced goods and services, which would reduce aggregate demand even further.\n\n8. Inequality reduces aggregate demand by reducing the ability of households to consume government-provided services such as education and health care. When people have less money to spend, they may choose not to use these services as much or at all, which would reduce aggregate demand even further.\n\n9. Inequality reduces aggregate demand by reducing the ability of households to save for retirement or other long-term goals. When people have less money to spend, they may choose not to save as much for retirement or other long-term goals, which would reduce aggregate demand even further in the future when these individuals retire or reach other long-term goals such as buying a home or starting a business.\n\n10. Inequality reduces aggregate demand by reducing the ability of households to invest in human capital through education and training. When people have less money to spend, they may choose not to invest in their own human capital through education or training, which would reduce their productivity and output in the future when they enter the workforce or start a business of their own.\n\n11.

It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in poverty by the percentage change in GDP per capita.\n\nThe growth elasticity of poverty can depend on the existing level of inequality because economic growth can have different effects on poverty depending on the level of inequality in a country.

The passage states that a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction in poverty as a country with low inequality. This means that a country with high inequality would take longer to reduce poverty than a country with low inequality.\n\nThe reason for this is that economic growth can only reduce poverty if it is distributed fairly. If there is a large gap between the rich and the poor, then the benefits of economic growth will be concentrated among the rich, while the poor will not see any improvement in their standard of living. This is because the rich will be able to invest their money in ways that benefit them more than the poor, such as buying assets or investing in businesses.\n\nIn contrast, if there is a smaller gap between the rich and the poor, then economic growth will be more evenly distributed, and everyone will benefit from it.

Wars and construction projects had drained the Mongol treasury. Efforts to raise and collect tax revenues were plagued by corruption and political scandals. Mishandled military expeditions followed the financial problems. Kublai's second invasion of Japan in 1281 failed because of an inauspicious typhoon. Kublai botched his campaigns against Annam, Champa, and Java, but won a Pyrrhic victory against Burma. The expeditions were hampered by disease, an inhospitable climate, and a tropical terrain unsuitable for the mounted warfare of the Mongols. The Tran dynasty which ruled Annam (Dai Viet) crushed and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288). The Chinese region of Fujian was the original home of the Chinese Tran (Chen) clan before they migrated under Trần Kinh (陳京, Chén Jīng) to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the Trần dynasty which ruled Vietnam Đại Việt, and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Trần prince Trần Quốc Tuấn (later King Trần Hưng Đạo) in 1282. Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion.

The Battle of Bạch Đằng was a battle fought between the Mongols and the Tran dynasty in 1288. The Mongols were defeated by the Tran, who were led by Trần Hưng Đạo. The battle took place in the present-day province of Quảng Nam, Vietnam.\n\nThe Battle of Bạch Đằng was a significant victory for the Tran dynasty, as it marked the beginning of their expansion into central Vietnam. The battle was also significant for the Mongols, as it was their first major defeat in Southeast Asia. The Mongols had previously been successful in conquering much of China and parts of Central Asia, but they had not yet encountered a strong opponent in Southeast Asia. The defeat at Bạch Đằng signaled the beginning of the end for the Mongol Empire in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Battle of Bạch Đằng is often considered to be one of the most important battles in Vietnamese history, as it marked the beginning of Vietnamese independence from foreign rule.

The humoral system is a theory in traditional Chinese medicine that states that the body is composed of five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. This theory was developed by the ancient Chinese philosopher Huangdi and was later adopted by Western medicine. The humoral system was based on the idea that the body was composed of different fluids, or humors, that circulated through the body and affected its health.\n\nThe Chinese disliked the humoral system because it contradicted their belief in yin-yang and wuxing philosophy. Yin-yang is a concept in traditional Chinese philosophy that describes how opposite forces are interconnected and interdependent in nature. Wuxing is a concept in traditional Chinese philosophy that describes the five elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These two concepts were central to traditional Chinese medicine and were believed to be essential for maintaining health and balance in the body.\n\nThe Chinese had access to Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine, which was a seminal work in Western medicine. The Canon of Medicine was written by the Persian physician Avicenna (Ibn Sina) and was one of the most influential medical texts of the medieval period. It was translated into Latin and became a standard textbook for medical students in Europe. The Canon of Medicine described Western medical practices such as anatomy, physiology, pathology, and pharmacology.

Daoism, on the other hand, is a philosophical system that emphasizes the importance of nature and the interconnectedness of all things.\n\nBoth Confucianism and Daoism influenced the development of Chinese medicine, which was based on the belief that the body was a reflection of the natural world and that illness was caused by imbalances in the body's energy or qi.

Chloroplasts are organelles found in the cells of plants and some algae that contain their own DNA, called chloroplast DNA or cpDNA.\n\nChloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which plants use sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose. Chloroplasts contain the enzymes and proteins needed for this process, as well as the pigments that absorb light and convert it into energy.\n\nThe term \"plastid DNA\" is used to refer to the DNA found in the chloroplasts of plants. This type of DNA is unique because it contains genes that are essential for photosynthesis and other plant functions.

One of the goals of the Muslim Brotherhood is to promote the welfare of Muslims and to improve their quality of life. One way that the Muslim Brotherhood has sought to achieve this goal is by facilitating inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies.\n\nIn many parts of the world, including in some Muslim-majority countries, marriage can be a costly affair. In some cases, families may be required to pay large sums of money in dowry payments to the groom's family in order to marry their daughter. This can be a significant financial burden for many families, especially those who are already struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood has worked to address this issue by facilitating inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies. These ceremonies are typically organized by the Muslim Brotherhood or other Islamist groups, and they aim to bring together large numbers of people for the purpose of marrying them in a single ceremony. The goal is to reduce the cost of marriage for each individual participant, while also providing a sense of community and solidarity among those who participate.\n\nIn addition to reducing the cost of marriage, these mass marriage ceremonies also aim to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands. By bringing together large numbers of people for the purpose of marrying them, the Muslim Brotherhood hopes to create a sense of community and solidarity among participants, which can help reduce the incidence of dowry demands.\n\nOverall, the Muslim Brotherhood's efforts to facilitate inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies are an example of how they seek to improve the quality of life for Muslims and promote social justice.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

The party was a member of the Sudanese National Congress, a coalition of opposition groups that was formed in 1983. The National Islamic Front was one of the most influential political parties in Sudan during the 1980s and 1990s, and it played a key role in the country's transition to democracy.\n\nThe National Islamic Front was led by Hassan al-Turabi, who served as the party's chairman from its founding until his arrest in 1999. Al-Turabi was a prominent Islamist scholar and politician who advocated for an Islamic state in Sudan. He also served as the country's minister of education from 1979 to 1985, and he was a key figure in the Islamist movement that emerged in Sudan during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe National Islamic Front was known for its strong opposition to secularism and Western influence in Sudan, and it advocated for an Islamic state based on Sharia law. The party also supported the establishment of an independent state for the Darfur region, which had been under rebel control since 2003.\n\nThe National Islamic Front played a key role in Sudan's transition to democracy after decades of authoritarian rule under Gaafar al-Nimeiry. The party participated in several rounds of negotiations with other opposition groups, including the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army, which led to the signing of the Addis Ababa Peace Agreement in 2005. The agreement paved the way for a peaceful transition to democracy and paved the way for multiparty elections in 2010.\n\nThe National Islamic Front continued to play a prominent role in Sudanese politics after the transition to democracy, but it faced increasing challenges from other political parties and civil society groups. The party's influence declined significantly after al-Turabi's arrest in 1999, and it has since been banned by the government several times.\n\nIn summary, the answer to your question is \"National Islamic Front\", which is a political party that was founded by Hassan al-Turabi and played a key role in Sudan's transition to democracy after decades of authoritarian rule under Gaafar al-Nimeiry.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West’s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled. The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories.\n\nQuestion:\n\nThe West saw themselves as what compared to the east?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.
