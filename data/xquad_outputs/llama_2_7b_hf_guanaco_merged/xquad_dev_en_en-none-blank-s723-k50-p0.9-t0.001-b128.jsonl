Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence.\n\nPassage:\n\nIn 1900, Tesla was granted patents for a \"system of transmitting electrical energy\" and \"an electrical transmitter.\" When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first-ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents, though there is little to support this claim. This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhen did Tesla attain his electrical transmitter patent?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.

Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin burst and the fire erupted onto the pad area, frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat type of atmosphere helped fuel the fire throughout the cabin?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\".

The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU.

Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence.\n\nPassage:\n\nBecause of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue. Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy are ctenophores extremely rare as fossils?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number. Provide the answer in quotations.### Assistant: Based on the passage, the answer to the question is \"", "system": "Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils.\"\n\nThe passage states that ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils because of their soft, gelatinous bodies. This means that they are difficult to preserve in the fossil record due to their soft tissue and lack of hard structures.

The plague of 1576–77 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679.

A new four-note theme tune was introduced alongside the package, based around the network's \"We Love TV\" image campaign introduced that year, creating an audio signature on par with the NBC chimes, CBS' various three-note soundmarks (including the current version used since 2000) and the Fox Fanfare. The four-note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter (though variants of it used since the 1998–99 season remain in use during the production company vanity cards shown following the closing credits of most programs).

Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections.

It can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic diseases, acquired conditions, and the use of immunosuppressive medications.\n\nIn the passage, it states that immunodeficiency can be caused by genetic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, and the use of immunosuppressive medications. SCID is a rare genetic disorder that causes a person's immune system to not develop properly, leading to an increased risk of infections and other health problems. HIV/AIDS is an acquired condition that weakens the immune system, making it more difficult for the body to fight off infections. Immunosuppressive medications are used to treat certain conditions, such as organ transplants, but can also weaken the immune system and increase the risk of infections.\n\nIn summary, immunodeficiency can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic diseases, acquired conditions, and the use of immunosuppressive medications.

The Peterloo massacre was a violent confrontation between a large crowd of protesters and the military and police forces of the British government, which took place on August 16, 1819, in St. Peter's Fields in Manchester, England. The protesters were gathered to demand political reforms, including the extension of the franchise to all men over the age of 21 and the abolition of slavery. The massacre resulted in the deaths of at least 15 people and the injury of hundreds more.\n\nThe poem \"The Mask of Anarchy\" was written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in response to the massacre, and it is considered one of the earliest examples of nonviolent protest in modern history. The poem's opening lines describe a figure who represents the oppressed and downtrodden, and it calls for a new form of social action that is based on nonviolence and resistance to unjust authority. The poem's message resonated with many people at the time, including Henry David Thoreau, who later adapted it into his essay \"Civil Disobedience\", and Mahatma Gandhi, who used it as inspiration for his doctrine of Satyagraha.\n\nIn summary, \"The Mask of Anarchy\" was written to protest against the Peterloo massacre and to call for a new form of social action based on nonviolence and resistance to unjust authority.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

This type of contract is often used in construction projects where the client wants a single entity to take responsibility for the entire project, from design to completion.\n\nIn a design-build contract, the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance specifications. This means that the contractor is responsible for both the design and construction of the project, and must ensure that the project meets the performance specifications set by the client.\n\nThe design-build contract is becoming increasingly popular in recent years, as it offers several advantages over traditional construction methods. For example, it can reduce costs by streamlining the design and construction process, and it can also reduce risk by ensuring that the project is completed on time and within budget.\n\nIn summary, based on the passage, the answer to the question is \"design-build contract\".", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

In other words, if a property holds for all elements of Q, then it also holds for all elements of any completion of Q. This principle is important in number theory because it allows for the transfer of certain arithmetic questions from Q to the completed fields.

He came back to Lahore in 1908. While dividing his time between law practice and philosophical poetry, Iqbal had remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in World War I and remained in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as Muhammad Ali Johar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

Cultural imperialism is often referred to as \"soft power\" because it involves the use of cultural and social influence to shape the attitudes and behaviors of people in other countries. This type of influence is often more subtle and less overt than the use of military or economic power, and it can be more effective in shaping long-term cultural and social change.\n\nThe passage provides several examples of how cultural imperialism can be used to shape the attitudes and behaviors of people in other countries. In the case of Romania during the Cold War, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas changed the expectations of Romanians and influenced their desire for their own country to become more like the United States. In North Korea, smuggled South Korean drama series have had a significant impact on the country's culture and social norms.\n\nCultural imperialism is not limited to foreign popular culture, but can also include the use of language, religion, education, and other forms of cultural expression to shape the attitudes and behaviors of people in other countries. The passage notes that authoritarian regimes often fight against cultural imperialism by banning foreign popular culture, controlling the internet, and restricting access to satellite dishes.\n\nIn summary, cultural imperialism is often referred to as \"soft power\" because it involves the use of cultural and social influence to shape the attitudes and behaviors of people in other countries.

It is a self-consistent model that combines the four fundamental interactions (electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force, and gravity) into a single theory.\n\nString theory is based on the idea that the fundamental constituents of matter are not point-like particles, but instead are tiny vibrating strings. These strings have different vibrational modes, which correspond to different particles and forces. By combining these different vibrational modes, string theory can explain all the known particles and forces in nature.\n\nString theory has been a topic of intense research for decades, but it has not yet been proven to be correct.

In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field.
