Computational complexity theory is a branch of theoretical computer science that studies the computational complexity of various problems, which is defined as the minimum number of steps required to solve a problem. Complexity is a main attribute used to classify computational problems, as it determines how difficult it is to solve a problem and how much time and resources are required to solve it.\n\nIn computational complexity theory, problems are classified based on their complexity, which is measured by the number of steps required to solve them. The higher the complexity, the more difficult it is to solve the problem and the more resources are required to solve it. Some common examples of computational problems include:\n\n1. NP-complete problems: These are problems that are known to be NP-complete, which means that they can be solved in polynomial time using a deterministic algorithm. Examples of NP-complete problems include the traveling salesman problem and the knapsack problem.\n\n2. NP-hard problems: These are problems that are known to be NP-hard, which means that they can be solved in polynomial time using an efficient algorithm. Examples of NP-hard problems include the graph coloring problem and the knapsack problem.\n\n3. P-complete problems: These are problems that can be solved in polynomial time using a randomized algorithm. Examples of P-complete problems include the set cover problem and the vertex cover problem.\n\n4. PSPACE-complete problems: These are problems that can be solved in polynomial time using a probabilistic algorithm. Examples of PSPACE-complete problems include the graph coloring problem and the set cover problem.\n\n5. BPP-complete problems: These are problems that can be solved in polynomial time using a deterministic algorithm with a bounded number of bits of memory. Examples of BPP-complete problems include the knapsack problem and the vertex cover problem.\n\nIn summary, computational complexity theory classifies computational problems based on their complexity, which is measured by the number of steps required to solve them and the resources required to solve them.

In a computational problem, the string is often used to represent the input data or the problem instance. For example, in a problem involving text processing, the string could represent the text to be processed, while in a problem involving graph theory, the string could represent the vertices and edges of a graph.\n\nThe string is typically encoded using an encoding function that maps each symbol or character in the string to a bit in the binary alphabet. For example, in a problem involving text processing, the encoding function could map each character in the string to a bit in the binary alphabet, while in a problem involving graph theory, the encoding function could map each vertex or edge in the graph to a bit in the binary alphabet.\n\nIn summary, a string over an alphabet is a mathematical object that represents a sequence of symbols or characters and is typically encoded using an encoding function that maps each symbol or character in the string to a bit in the binary alphabet.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

For instance, the set of problems solvable within time f(n) on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(f(n)).\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the most critical resource measured to in assessing the determination of a Turing machine's ability to solve any given set of problems?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

If anyone says that he cannot confess his sins without taking an oath or making an abjuration, he is not only wrong but also guilty of blasphemy against God.\"\n\nThis statement by Luther describes how monks and nuns could break their vows without sin, because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation. Luther believed that monks and nuns should not take vows because they were unnecessary and could lead to sin. He believed that every Christian had access to God through prayer and faith, and that no vow was necessary for salvation.\n\nIn summary, Luther described the mass as a gift to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation in On the Abrogation of the Private Mass.

The \"Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006\" (VCHRR Act)\n\nThese provisions are entrenched because they require a special process to amend them, such as a referendum or a majority vote in both houses of Parliament. For example, the VCHRR Act requires a referendum to be held before any changes can be made to the Charter, while the VCBHA Act requires a majority vote in both houses of Parliament before any changes can be made to the Charter.\n\nIt is important to note that these provisions are not the only entrenched provisions in Victoria's constitution, as there are other provisions that may also require special consideration to amend.

The name \"Eleutherian\" is derived from the Greek word \"eleutheros,\" which means \"free man.\" The name was chosen to reflect du Pont's desire to create a free and independent gunpowder operation that would not be subject to the control of any government or political entity.\n\nThe Eleutherian Mills were located in Wilmington, Delaware, and were one of the largest gunpowder operations in the United States at the time. The operation produced gunpowder for both military and civilian use, and was known for its high quality and reliability. The Eleutherian Mills were also known for their innovative production methods, which included the use of steam power to drive the machinery.\n\nThe Eleutherian Mills operated for over 50 years, until it was eventually acquired by the DuPont Company in 1919.

He was born in 1819 in the town of Schwerin, which was then part of the Kingdom of Prussia. His father, Johann Friedrich Fontane, was a Lutheran pastor and his mother, Anna Maria von Schwerin, was a descendant of French Huguenots who had fled to Germany to escape religious persecution.\n\nFontane's family moved to Berlin in 1824, where he attended school and later studied law at the University of Berlin. He became interested in literature and poetry at an early age, and his first poems were published when he was only 17 years old.\n\nIn 1842, Fontane married Charlotte von Schwerin, the daughter of a Prussian nobleman. The couple had four children, but only two survived into adulthood.\n\nFontane's literary career took off in the 1840s, when he published his first novel, \"The Duel\". He went on to publish several more novels and short stories, including \"The Duelist\", \"The Duel\", and \"The Last Journey\".\n\nIn addition to his literary work, Fontane also served as a diplomat for the Prussian government. He was appointed consul in Paris in 1858 and served in that capacity until 1861. During this time, he wrote several articles about French culture and politics for German newspapers.\n\nFontane's most famous work is probably his novel \"Effi Briest\", which was published in 1862. The novel tells the story of a young woman who marries into a wealthy Prussian family but finds herself trapped in an unhappy marriage. The novel is considered a classic of German literature and has been translated into many languages.\n\nFontane died in 1898 at the age of 79. He is buried in Berlin's Grunewald Cemetery.

Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence.\n\nPassage:\n\nA steam turbine consists of one or more rotors (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of stators (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing. The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing.

In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.

Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. Increasing the pressure of O\n2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat occurs after a dive in which a diver decompresses too quickly?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

The passage states that the other nations had to pay \"ten times more\" for oil after the surprise attack. This implies that the price of oil increased by a factor of ten, or 1000%, after the surprise attack.\n\nIt is important to note that this increase in price was not a one-time event, but rather a sustained increase in the price of oil that lasted for several years. This increase in price was due to a combination of factors, including the disruption of oil supplies caused by the attack, increased demand for oil from Western countries, and geopolitical tensions between the West and the Middle East.\n\nThe increase in price of oil after the surprise attack had a significant impact on the global economy, as it led to higher prices for goods and services that rely on oil as an input. This included fuel for transportation, heating, and manufacturing, as well as food and other consumer goods that are produced using petroleum-based products. The increase in price also led to higher inflation rates in many countries, which further impacted economic growth and development.\n\nOverall, the surprise attack on Israel by Syria and Egypt in October 1973 had a significant impact on the global economy, including the price of oil. The increase in price of oil after the surprise attack led to higher prices for goods and services that rely on oil as an input, which had a ripple effect on economic growth and development.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode.

According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10, the EU observes \"the principle of equality of its citizens\" and is meant to be founded on \"representative democracy\". In practice, equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries, and \"qualified majorities\" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. The justification for this \"democratic deficit\" under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts, while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999).

The European Commission is the executive body of the European Union, responsible for proposing and implementing EU legislation. It has a monopoly on initiating legislation, as it is the only body that can propose new laws and regulations. The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process, but they cannot propose new laws or regulations. The European Commission is also responsible for enforcing EU law, and it has the power to take legal action against member states that do not comply with EU laws. In practice, the European Commission has a significant amount of power and influence over EU legislation, and it is often seen as the \"real\" government of the EU.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the European Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, it does not have complete control over the legislative process. The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union also have significant powers and influence over EU legislation. For example, the European Parliament can reject or amend proposed legislation from the European Commission, and it can also initiate its own proposals for new laws. The Council of the European Union has veto power over proposed EU legislation, and it can reject or amend proposed legislation from the European Commission. In addition, national governments also have a role in shaping EU legislation through their representatives in the European Parliament and Council.\n\nIn summary, while the European Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, it does not have complete control over the legislative process. Other bodies such as the European Parliament and Council of the European Union also have significant powers and influence over EU legislation.

Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence.\n\nPassage:\n\nSince its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIf there is a conflict between EU law and national law, which law take precedence?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number. Provide the answer in quotations.### Assistant: Based on the passage, the answer to the question is \"", "system": "EU law takes precedence over national law in cases of conflict.\" This is because the European Union (EU) has its own legal system, which is separate from the legal systems of individual member states. The EU's legal system is based on the principle of primacy, which means that EU law takes precedence over national law in cases of conflict.\n\nThe EU's legal system is based on a series of treaties and regulations that establish the rights and obligations of EU member states and the institutions of the EU. These treaties and regulations are directly applicable in all member states, and they have primacy over any conflicting national laws. For example, if there is a conflict between EU law and national law in the area of competition policy, the EU competition rules will take precedence over any conflicting national laws.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the primacy of EU law does not mean that member states have no say in how EU law is implemented. Member states can still have some influence over the interpretation and application of EU law through their participation in the legislative process and through their representation on EU bodies such as the European Parliament and the European Commission. Additionally, some areas of EU law, such as social policy, are not directly applicable and are instead implemented through national laws. In these cases, national laws may take precedence over EU law if they are more protective of individual rights or if they are more effective in achieving policy goals.\n\nOverall, it is important to remember that while EU law takes precedence over national law in cases of conflict, there are still some areas where national laws may have more influence. However, it is also important to note that the primacy of EU law does not mean that member states have no say in how EU law is implemented or enforced. Rather, it reflects a balance between the need for a unified legal system for the EU and the need for member states to retain some control over their own legal systems.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU.

Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence.\n\nPassage:\n\nIn 2010 the Amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought, in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought. The affected region was approximate 1,160,000 square miles (3,000,000 km2) of rainforest, compared to 734,000 square miles (1,900,000 km2) in 2005. The 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off, whereas in 2005 the drought was focused on the southwestern part. The findings were published in the journal Science. In a typical year the Amazon absorbs 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide; during 2005 instead 5 gigatons were released and in 2010 8 gigatons were released.\n\nQuestion:\n\nThe southern part of the Amazon forest was mainly impacted by drought in what year?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

This suggests that the drought in 2010 was more widespread and affected a larger area of the Amazon rainforest than the drought in 2005.\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Science, which indicates that the research on the impact of the drought was conducted by scientists and published in a scientific journal. The findings were also presented at a scientific conference, which suggests that they were peer-reviewed and considered to be reliable by experts in the field.\n\nIn summary, the answer to your question is \"2010\", as this was the year when the southern part of the Amazon rainforest was mainly impacted by drought.

Provide the answer in quotations.### Assistant: Based on the passage, the answer to the question is \"", "system": "Each packet is routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery.\" This is because the packets are routed individually, which means that each packet has its own route to follow. This can result in different paths and out-of-order delivery, as the packets may take different routes to reach their destination. Additionally, the lack of a dedicated path can make it more difficult for the packets to find their way to their destination, as they may have to go through multiple hops before reaching their destination.\n\nThis is a key difference between connectionless and connection-oriented protocols, as connection-oriented protocols provide a dedicated path for each packet to follow, while connectionless protocols do not.

The germ theory of disease was first proposed in the late 19th century by Louis Pasteur and others, and it has since become the dominant explanation for the spread of many infectious diseases.\n\nThe germ theory of disease is based on several key observations and experiments that led to its development. One of the most important observations was the work of Robert Koch, who discovered that certain bacteria were responsible for causing specific diseases. He developed a method for isolating and growing these bacteria in laboratory cultures, which allowed him to demonstrate their role in disease.\n\nAnother important observation was the work of Joseph Lister, who pioneered the use of antiseptic techniques in surgery. He observed that surgical wounds that were not properly cleaned and treated with antiseptics were more likely to become infected than those that were. This led him to develop a method for sterilizing surgical instruments and dressings, which helped to reduce the spread of infection.\n\nThe germ theory of disease also took into account the work of other scientists, such as Emil von Behring and Paul Ehrlich, who developed methods for identifying specific types of bacteria and developing vaccines against them. These discoveries led to the development of effective treatments for many infectious diseases, such as smallpox and cholera.\n\nThe germ theory of disease has had a significant impact on public health and medicine, leading to the development of vaccines, antibiotics, and other treatments that have saved millions of lives.

Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence.\n\nPassage:\n\nA variety of alternatives to the Y. pestis have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat does Graham Twigg propose about the spread of disease?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

It is also in quotations, as it is a direct quote from the passage.\n\nThe Black Death was a pandemic that occurred in Europe during the 14th century. It is believed to have been caused by the bubonic plague, which is a type of bacterial infection that spreads through bites from infected fleas.

The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks, and fossils are used to determine the relative age of the formations in which they are found.\n\nThe principle of faunal succession is a fundamental concept in geology and paleontology that describes how the fossil record reflects the changing diversity of life over time. It is based on the principle that fossils are found in rocks of a certain age, and that the presence or absence of a particular fossil can be used to determine the relative age of the rock in which it is found.\n\nThe principle of faunal succession was developed by William Smith, an English geologist, in the early 19th century. He observed that fossils were often found in layers of rock that were deposited at different times, and he proposed that these layers could be used to determine the relative age of the rocks in which they were found. This principle was later formalized by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in their theory of evolution, which proposed that species evolved over time and that fossils were evidence of past life forms.\n\nThe principle of faunal succession is still used today by paleontologists and geologists to understand the history of life on Earth and to date rock formations.

In his paper, Hutton proposed a theory of geology that was based on the idea that the Earth was much older than previously thought and that it had been formed through gradual processes over a long period of time.\n\nHutton's theory of uniformitarianism was based on the idea that the Earth's processes were relatively constant and predictable over time. He argued that the Earth's surface had been formed through gradual processes such as erosion and deposition, and that these processes had been operating for a long time. He believed that these processes were still operating today, and that they would continue to operate in the future.\n\nHutton's theory of uniformitarianism was a major departure from the prevailing ideas of his time, which were based on the idea of catastrophism. According to this theory, the Earth had been created in a single event, such as a cataclysmic flood or volcanic eruption, and had then undergone gradual changes over time. Hutton's theory challenged this idea and argued for a more gradual and predictable process of change.\n\nHutton's theory of uniformitarianism was highly influential in shaping modern geology and led to significant advances in our understanding of the Earth's history. His ideas were challenged by other geologists, but his theory remained influential for many years.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

It was given the family name of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD. This rare honour suggests that Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain. The population of Pons Aelius at this period was estimated at 2,000. Fragments of Hadrian's Wall are still visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the \"Roman Wall\" can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort in Wallsend—the \"wall's end\"—and to the supply fort Arbeia in South Shields. The extent of Hadrian's Wall was 73 miles (117 km), spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was constructed primarily for defence, to prevent unwanted immigration and the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, not as a fighting line for a major invasion.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat was the first recorded settlement in what became Newcastle?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

The name \"Pons Aelius\" is a reference to the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who founded the settlement in the 2nd century AD. The name \"Pons Aelius\" is a Latin term that means \"bridge of Hadrian\".\n\nThe first recorded settlement in what became Newcastle was Pons Aelius, a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. The bridge was built by the Romans to connect their military base at Vindolanda with their supply fort at Arbeia, which was located on the opposite bank of the Tyne. The bridge was named after Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD.\n\nThe population of Pons Aelius at this period was estimated at 2,000.

The bridge was named after him and connected his military base at Vindolanda with his supply fort at Arbeia on the opposite bank of the Tyne. The bridge was built to connect these two important Roman bases and served as a vital link between them.

Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence.\n\nPassage:\n\nThe advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering.

Glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.

Civil disobedience is a form of nonviolent resistance to unjust laws or policies, and it is often used to draw attention to a particular issue or cause. By engaging in civil disobedience, people can make their voices heard and try to change the system or policy they are protesting against.\n\nCivil disobedience can take many forms, such as boycotts, strikes, sit-ins, and non-payment of taxes.

Thus, each such firm may offer itself as \"one-stop shopping\" for a construction project, from beginning to end. This is designated as a \"design build\" contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance specifications.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat kind of contract is given when the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance specifications?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number. Provide the answer in quotations.### Assistant: Based on the passage, the answer to the question is \"", "system": "design build contract\".\n\nThe design build contract is a type of construction contract where the contractor is responsible for both the design and construction of a project. The contractor is given a performance specification, which is a detailed description of the project's requirements, and must undertake the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance specifications.\n\nIn a design build contract, the contractor is responsible for all aspects of the project, including design, engineering, construction, and any other services required. This type of contract can be beneficial for clients who want to streamline the process of building a project and ensure that all aspects are completed according to specifications.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that design build contracts can be more expensive than traditional contracts, as they require more oversight and management by the contractor. Additionally, there is a risk that the contractor may not adhere to the performance specifications or may not complete the project on time or within budget. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the qualifications and experience of the contractor before entering into a design build contract.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is a numerical scale used to classify hurricanes based on their maximum sustained wind speed and the damage they cause. It ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe. Hurricanes with winds of 111 mph (178 km/h) or higher are classified as Category 5 hurricanes, while those with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) or higher are classified as Category 5 hurricanes.\n\nThe Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale was developed by Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson in the 1970s to provide a standardized way to classify hurricanes based on their potential for damage. The scale was originally developed for use in the United States, but it has since been adopted by other countries, including Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale is important because it helps emergency responders and the public prepare for and respond to hurricanes. Knowing the strength of a hurricane can help people decide whether to evacuate or stay put, and it can also help emergency responders determine the best course of action to take during a hurricane. For example, Category 5 hurricanes are extremely dangerous and can cause widespread damage and loss of life.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer to your question is the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, which is a numerical scale used to classify hurricanes based on their maximum sustained wind speed and the damage they cause.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

He argued that the distribution of income and wealth within countries is a key determinant of aggregate demand, and that high levels of inequality can reduce aggregate demand by reducing consumption and investment. He also argued that high levels of inequality within countries can reduce the efficiency of resource allocation, leading to lower productivity and slower economic growth.\n\nStiglitz's presentation of this evidence was significant because it provided a new perspective on the relationship between inequality and economic growth. Prior to this presentation, the focus on inequality had primarily been on its impact on social welfare and equity. Stiglitz's presentation showed that inequality can also have negative economic consequences by limiting aggregate demand and reducing productivity.

This is because as economies develop, they become more efficient and productive, which leads to higher wages and incomes for workers. However, as economies mature, the benefits of economic growth are shared more evenly across society, leading to a reduction in income inequality.\n\nStudies on income inequality have found evidence confirming this hypothesis in some cases. For example, studies have found that income inequality tends to increase in developing countries during the early stages of economic development, but then decreases as economies mature. This is because in these countries, there is a large gap between the incomes of the rich and the poor, which widens as economies develop. However, as economies mature and become more efficient and productive, this gap tends to narrow as incomes become more evenly distributed.\n\nHowever, studies have also found evidence challenging the Kuznets curve hypothesis. For example, Thomas Piketty argues that from 1914 to 1945 wars and \"violent economic and political shocks\" reduced inequality in many developed countries. He argues that these shocks disrupted economic growth and led to a redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor. Moreover, Piketty argues that the \"magical\" Kuznets curve hypothesis, with its emphasis on the balancing of economic growth in the long run, cannot account for the significant increase in economic inequality throughout the developed world since the 1970s.\n\nIn conclusion, studies on income inequality have sometimes found evidence confirming the Kuznets curve hypothesis, but also challenging it. The Kuznets curve hypothesis is a complex theory that has been subject to much debate and criticism over time.

The buildings are connected by a series of bridges and walkways that create a sense of openness and transparency. The design of the buildings is characterized by clean lines, geometric shapes, and the use of glass and steel. The buildings are also known for their innovative use of technology, such as the use of air conditioning and lighting systems that respond to natural light.\n\nLudwig Mies van der Rohe was a leading figure in the modernist movement in architecture and design. He was born in Germany in 1886 and studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin. He moved to Chicago in 1937 to work as an architect for the Armour Institute of Technology, which later became part of the University of Chicago.

The Battle of Bạch Đằng was a decisive battle in the history of the Mongol-Tran War, which took place in 1288. The battle was fought between the Mongols and the Tran dynasty, which ruled Vietnam at the time. The Tran dynasty had been established by Chinese immigrants from Fujian province in southern China, and they had been fighting against the Mongols for several years. The Tran dynasty was eventually defeated by the Mongols at the Battle of Bạch Đằng, which resulted in the loss of their independence and the establishment of Mongol rule over Vietnam.\n\nThe Battle of Bạch Đằng was a significant event in the history of both Vietnam and China, as it marked the end of the Mongol-Tran War and the beginning of a new era of Mongol rule over Vietnam. The battle was fought on a small island in the middle of a river, and it resulted in a decisive victory for the Mongols. The Tran dynasty was defeated, and their capital city was captured by the Mongols. This marked the end of their independence and ushered in a new era of Mongol rule over Vietnam.\n\nThe Battle of Bạch Đằng is significant for several reasons. It marked the end of a long war between two powerful empires, and it resulted in a significant shift in power in Asia.

Professor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion.

Provide the answer in quotations.### Assistant: Based on the passage, the answer to the question is \"", "system": "1288\". The Battle of Bạch Đằng was fought in 1288 between the Mongols and the Tran dynasty of Vietnam. The Mongols were defeated by the Tran, who were led by Trần Quốc Tuấn (later King Trần Hưng Đạo). This marked the end of the Mongol invasion of Vietnam and the beginning of the Tran dynasty.\n\nIt is important to note that the Mongols were not defeated in a single battle, but rather over a period of time. The Mongol invasion of Vietnam began in 1279 and continued until 1288, when the Battle of Bạch Đằng was fought. The Mongols were ultimately defeated by the Tran dynasty, but it took several years for them to be fully driven out of Vietnam.\n\nIt is also important to note that the Mongols were not defeated by the Tran alone. They faced resistance from other Vietnamese dynasties, such as the Dai Viet and Champa, as well as from local Vietnamese forces. The Mongols were ultimately defeated by a combination of factors, including military might, political maneuvering, and local resistance.\n\nIn conclusion, the Battle of Bạch Đằng was a significant event in Vietnamese history, marking the end of the Mongol invasion and the beginning of the Tran dynasty.

The Miller–Rabin primality test is a fast and efficient algorithm for testing the primality of large numbers. It was developed by Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman in 1994 and is based on the Miller–Rabin cryptographic primality test. The algorithm is named after its inventors, Shamir and Adleman.\n\nThe Miller–Rabin primality test is a probabilistic algorithm that uses the Miller–Rabin oracle to determine whether a given number n is prime or not. The oracle is a mathematical function that returns either \"yes\" or \"no\" depending on whether n is prime or not. The algorithm works by repeatedly applying the Miller–Rabin oracle to n until it returns \"yes\". If the oracle returns \"no\" for all values of n up to a certain limit, then n is known to be prime.\n\nThe Miller–Rabin primality test has several advantages over other algorithms for testing the primality of large numbers. It is fast, efficient, and easy to implement. It also has a low probability of error, making it suitable for practical applications. Additionally, it can be used to test the primality of composite numbers, which other algorithms may not be able to do.\n\nIn conclusion, the Miller–Rabin primality test is a fast and efficient algorithm for testing the primality of large numbers.

It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots. Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat does it mean for a knot to be considered indecomposable?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

It is one of the largest rivers in Europe, with a length of approximately 1,230 kilometers (764 miles). During the last Ice Age, the Rhine was the main channel for the discharge of glacial meltwater from the European ice sheets. The Rhine and its tributaries carried the meltwater to the North Sea, where it was deposited as sediment and formed a large delta.\n\nThe Rhine and its tributaries were also important for human settlement during the last Ice Age. The river provided a reliable source of water for agriculture and navigation, and it was an important trade route for exchanging goods and ideas between different regions. The Rhine also served as a natural barrier against invaders, as it was difficult to cross due to its steep banks and fast-flowing waters.\n\nOverall, the discharge of glacial meltwater from the European ice sheets during the last Ice Age was critical in shaping the landscape and environment of Europe. The Rhine and its tributaries played a key role in this process, carrying the meltwater to the North Sea and depositing it as sediment, creating a large delta.

By banning foreign popular culture, regimes can limit the exposure of their citizens to outside influences and maintain control over the cultural landscape. Controlling the internet and enforcing strict censorship can also help to prevent the spread of foreign ideas and information.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that cultural imperialism is a complex phenomenon that can be difficult to fully control. Regimes may find that their efforts to suppress foreign popular culture are ineffective or even counterproductive, as they may only serve to increase the appeal of the targeted culture among those who are exposed to it. Additionally, banning or censoring certain forms of popular culture may have unintended consequences, such as increasing demand for black market goods or creating a market for pirated content.\n\nUltimately, the most effective way to combat cultural imperialism is through a combination of strategies that address both the supply and demand sides of the equation. By promoting local cultural production and providing access to a wide range of information and entertainment options, regimes can help to create a more balanced and diverse cultural landscape that is less susceptible to outside influence.\n\nIn conclusion, while regimes may find it challenging to fully control cultural imperialism, taking steps to promote local culture and provide access to a diverse range of information and entertainment options can help to mitigate its effects.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years. Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it's impact on Europe, as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation. Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhen were Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell at their most prolific writing period?\n\nNote: Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage and be a single entity, name, or number.

He is best known for his work on the theory of economic development, which focused on the role of innovation and entrepreneurship in economic growth.\n\nNorman Angell was an English political scientist and writer who is best known for his book The Great Illusion, which argued that the First World War was a tragic mistake that could have been avoided through international cooperation and diplomacy. He was also a prominent pacifist and anti-war activist.\n\nIn conclusion, Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell were both at their most prolific during the interwar years, when they produced some of their most influential works on economic theory, political economy, and international relations.

String theory posits that the fundamental particles of the universe are not point-like but instead are one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings vibrate in a manner that is analogous to the vibrations of a guitar string, and they can interact with each other through the exchange of virtual particles called gravitons, photons, and gluons. String theory also posits that space-time itself is not a continuous fabric but instead is made up of tiny loops of string vibrating in various ways.\n\nString theory has been highly influential in physics and has led to many important discoveries, including the prediction of the existence of extra dimensions and the Higgs boson. However, it remains an incomplete theory and has not yet been proven to be correct.

The theory is based on the idea that space and time are not fixed, but rather are curved by the presence of matter and energy. This curvature causes objects to follow curved paths in space-time, rather than straight lines as would be expected in a Newtonian model.\n\nThe theory of general relativity has been extremely successful in explaining a wide range of phenomena, including the motion of planets and stars, the formation of black holes, and the bending of light by massive objects. It has also been used to develop powerful tools for calculating the gravitational effects of objects, such as the GRACE satellite mission, which measures changes in Earth's gravity caused by changes in water levels.\n\nIn summary, general relativity is the theory that best explains gravity, as it provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the gravitational force and its effects on objects in motion.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: Answer the question from the given passage.

The cross-sectional area is the area of a cross-section of an object, which is a two-dimensional shape that is perpendicular to the length and width of the object. The cross-sectional area is used to calculate the volume of an object by multiplying the length, width, and height of the object.\n\nThe cross-sectional area is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering, as it is used to calculate many physical quantities such as force, pressure, and stress. The cross-sectional area can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = Length * Width\n\nFor example, if an object has a length of 10 meters and a width of 5 meters, its cross-sectional area would be 50 meters squared (10 meters x 5 meters). This formula can be used to calculate the volume of an object by multiplying the cross-sectional area by its length, width, and height.\n\nIn summary, the cross-sectional area is used to calculate the volume of an object by multiplying its length, width, and height.
