The report was written by a group of experts from various fields, including political science, economics, and history. The report was released in January 2007 and was widely discussed in the media and among policymakers.\n\nThe Report was written in response to the growing tensions between the United States and the Middle East, particularly in Iraq and Iran. The authors of the report argued that the United States needed to engage in open debate and consensus-building about its policy towards the Middle East in order to address these tensions. They argued that the United States needed to understand the historical, cultural, and political factors that were driving these tensions, and to develop a policy that would address these factors while also taking into account American interests.\n\nThe Report was controversial for its frank assessment of the challenges facing the United States in the Middle East, as well as for its call for open debate and consensus-building. Some critics argued that the Report was too critical of American policy towards the Middle East, while others argued that it did not go far enough in addressing these challenges.

This process will continue for billions of years until the two galaxies eventually merge together to form a single large galaxy.\n\nThe Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are also in a process called \"gravitational lensing,\" which means that they are bending light from distant objects behind them, causing them to appear distorted and magnified. This effect can be seen in images of distant galaxies, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, which appears as a bright spot in the center of the image.\n\nIn conclusion, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy, causing it to move towards our galaxy and eventually merge with it over time. This process will continue for billions of years until our galaxy becomes one large galaxy with billions of stars and planets.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "Just like the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.", "secs": 0.30388530530035496, "reference": "जैसे चाँद पृथ्वी पर एक खिंचाव पैदा कर, ज्वार-भाटे का कारण बनता है, वैसे ही मिल्की वे भी धनु आकाशगंगा पर एक बल लगाता है."}

It is a serious and life-threatening form of TB that is difficult to treat and can be fatal if not treated properly.\n\nXDR-TB is a global health concern, with an estimated 500,000 cases worldwide in 2018. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified XDR-TB as one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019.\n\nXDR-TB is caused by bacteria that are resistant to at least two of the most powerful antibiotics used to treat TB, including isoniazid and rifampicin. These antibiotics are known as first-line drugs and are considered the gold standard for treating TB. XDR-TB is also resistant to at least one fluoroquinolone antibiotic, such as moxifloxacin or levofloxacin.\n\nXDR-TB is more difficult to treat than regular TB because it requires a longer course of treatment with more powerful antibiotics, which can be more expensive and have more side effects. XDR-TB can also spread more easily than regular TB, which makes it harder to control and prevent its spread.\n\nXDR-TB is a serious public health threat because it can be fatal if not treated properly. It can spread quickly and easily from person to person, especially in crowded or poorly ventilated settings such as hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. XDR-TB can also be transmitted through contaminated food or water.\n\nThe WHO recommends that people with XDR-TB should be treated in specialized facilities with experienced staff and appropriate infection control measures in place. This includes isolation from other patients and use of personal protective equipment such as gowns, gloves, and masks. Treatment for XDR-TB can take up to two years or longer, depending on the individual case.\n\nIt's important to note that XDR-TB is not contagious from person to person like regular TB. However, people with XDR-TB can still spread the disease through coughing or sneezing, so it's important to take precautions such as wearing a mask and washing your hands regularly to prevent transmission.\n\nIf you think you may have XDR-TB or have been exposed to someone with XDR-TB, it's important to seek medical attention immediately and inform your doctor about your exposure history.

In this case, the subject of the sentence is \"extra transport\", which is being acted upon by the event of \"being put on\".\n\n2. \"Car parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable at the ground.\" - This sentence is in the passive voice as well, but it's a little different from the previous one because it's not describing an event that's happening to someone else, but rather an event that's happening to something else. In this case, the subject of the sentence is \"parking and park-and-ride facilities\", which are being acted upon by the event of \"being unavailable\".\n\n3. \"Overground trains will not stop at Wembley.\" - This sentence is in the passive voice as well, but it's a little different from the previous two because it's not describing an event that's happening to someone else, but rather an event that's happening to something else. In this case, the subject of the sentence is \"overground trains\", which are being acted upon by the event of \"not stopping\".\n\n4. \"No extra transport is being put on and overground trains will not stop at Wembley.\" - This sentence is in the passive voice as well, but it's a little different from the previous three because it has two subjects: \"extra transport\" and \"overground trains\". The first subject, \"extra transport\", is being acted upon by the second subject, \"overground trains\", which means that there's a relationship between them. In this case, it's a relationship of cause and effect: extra transport is causing overground trains not to stop at Wembley.\n\n5. \"No extra transport is being put on and overground trains will not stop at Wembley.\" - This sentence is in the passive voice as well, but it's a little different from the previous four because it has three subjects: \"extra transport\", \"overground trains\", and \"Wembley\". The first two subjects are being acted upon by the third subject, which means that there's a relationship between them. In this case, it's a relationship of cause and effect: extra transport is causing overground trains not to stop at Wembley, which means that there will be no extra transport being put on and overground trains will not stop at Wembley.\n\n6. \"No extra transport is being put on and overground trains will not stop at Wembley.\" - This sentence is in the passive voice as well, but it's a little different from all of the previous ones because it has four subjects: \"extra transport\", \"overground trains\", \"Wembley\", and \"not stopping\". The first two subjects are being acted upon by the second two subjects, which means that there's a relationship between them. In this case, it's a relationship of cause and effect: extra transport is causing overground trains not to stop at Wembley, which means that there will be no extra transport being put on and overground trains will not stop at Wembley.\n\n7. Overall, all of these sentences are in passive voice because they describe events that are happening to something else rather than to someone or something directly.

It is observed on April 1 every year. The day was first observed in the United States in 2007 and has since been celebrated in many countries around the world. The goal of Autism Awareness Day is to promote understanding and acceptance of people with autism, to raise awareness about the challenges they face, and to encourage people to learn more about autism.\n\nOn this day, people can wear blue to show their support for people with autism and to raise awareness about the condition. They can also share information about autism on social media using the hashtag #AutismAwarenessDay. Organizations and businesses can also participate in events and activities that promote understanding and acceptance of people with autism.\n\nAutism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how a person communicates and interacts with others. It is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. People with autism may have trouble understanding social cues, communicating their needs or feelings, and engaging in activities that are typically enjoyable for others. They may also have unusual interests or behaviors that are not shared by others.\n\nAutism is a lifelong condition that affects people differently. Some people with autism may have mild symptoms while others may have more severe symptoms that require ongoing support and care. The cause of autism is not fully understood but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nAutism Awareness Day is an opportunity for people to learn more about autism and to show their support for people with autism. It is also a reminder that people with autism are part of our communities and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.

Their property was seized by the French king, who used it to fund his military campaigns. The order was officially dissolved in 1314.\n\nThe Templars' legacy has been controversial, as some historians have argued that they were unfairly targeted by the Catholic Church and that their suppression led to a decline in religious tolerance in Europe.

They are commonly found in beds, mattresses, and other areas where humans sleep. They can cause skin irritation, allergic reactions, and even psychological distress.\n\nBed-bugs are a common problem in many parts of the world, and they can be difficult to control. They can spread quickly through close contact with infested items or people, and they can be difficult to detect without the help of a professional.\n\nIf you think you have bed-bugs, it is important to take action quickly to prevent them from spreading and causing further damage. You can start by inspecting your bed and mattress for signs of bed-bugs, such as small brown or black spots on the surface or in the seams. You can also use a flashlight to check for live bed-bugs or their eggs in the crevices of your mattress or box spring.\n\nIf you find bed-bugs, it is important to act quickly to prevent them from spreading. You can start by vacuuming your mattress and box spring thoroughly, then washing all of your bedding in hot water and drying it on high heat.

Point mutations are changes in a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence, while structural mutations involve changes in the structure of the DNA itself. Point mutations can be either silent or missense mutations, while structural mutations can be either frameshift or nonsense mutations.\n\nPoint mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the location and type of mutation. For example, missense mutations can result in amino acid substitutions that change the function of a protein, while nonsense mutations can result in premature stop codons that cause the protein to be truncated or degraded before it can be produced.\n\nStructural mutations can also have a variety of different effects, depending on the location and type of mutation. For example, frameshift mutations can result in the deletion or insertion of nucleotides that disrupt the reading frame of a gene, leading to premature termination or readthrough of downstream genes. Nonsense mutations can result in truncation or degradation of proteins, while splice site mutations can result in aberrant splicing of mRNA transcripts.\n\nOverall, it is important to understand that mutations can have a wide range of effects depending on their location and type, and that these effects can vary significantly between different types of mutations.

It is important to understand the various factors that contribute to the success or failure of a transportation system. Some of the common reasons for complaints about transportation systems include:\n\n- Inefficient planning and design: Transportation systems are often designed without considering the needs of the community or the impact on the environment. This can lead to congestion, pollution, and other problems.\n\n- Lack of funding: Transportation systems require significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and personnel. However, funding for these systems is often limited, which can lead to underfunding and a lack of maintenance.\n\n- Poor management: Transportation systems require effective management to ensure that they operate efficiently and effectively. However, poor management can lead to delays, cancellations, and other problems.\n\n- Inadequate infrastructure: Transportation systems rely on a network of roads, bridges, tunnels, railways, airports, and other infrastructure. If this infrastructure is not maintained or expanded as needed, it can lead to congestion and other problems.\n\n- Lack of coordination: Transportation systems involve multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, private companies, and individuals. Effective coordination is essential for ensuring that all parties work together to achieve common goals. However, lack of coordination can lead to confusion and inefficiency.\n\n- Lack of public awareness: Many people are unaware of the importance of transportation systems and their impact on their daily lives. This lack of awareness can lead to apathy and indifference towards the problems faced by transportation systems.\n\nIt is important to understand the various factors that contribute to the success or failure of a transportation system in order to improve its performance and address the concerns of the community.

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory:\n\nMaslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory is a theory that explains the basic needs of humans and how they are prioritized in order of importance. The theory was developed by psychologist Abraham Maslow in the 1940s and has been widely used in psychology and management. The theory is based on the idea that humans have a hierarchy of needs, with the most basic needs being physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.\n\n2. Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory:\n\nHertzberg's Two Factor Theory is a theory that explains why employees are motivated or disengaged at work. The theory was developed by psychologist Frederick Herzberg in the 1950s and has been widely used in management and organizational psychology. The theory is based on the idea that employees are motivated by two factors: hygiene factors and motivators. Hygiene factors are things like salary, working conditions, and job security, while motivators are things like recognition, responsibility, advancement opportunities, and achievement.\n\n3. Conclusion:\n\nBoth Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory are useful tools for understanding human motivation and behavior in the workplace.

It is bordered by Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia. The name \"Paraguay\" comes from the Guaraní language and means \"flat-water people.\" The country's name was changed to Paraguay in 1812, after independence from Spain.\n\nThe history of Paraguay is rich and complex, with many different cultures and peoples contributing to its development. The indigenous people of Paraguay were divided into several groups, including the Guarani, Ayoreo, and Guaraní. These groups had their own languages and cultures, but they also interacted with Spanish settlers and other indigenous groups.\n\nThe Spanish conquest of Paraguay began in the 16th century, when Francisco de Orellana led an expedition to explore the Amazon River. He encountered the Guarani people, who were living in villages along the river. The Spanish quickly established settlements and began to trade with the indigenous people. However, tensions between the two groups soon arose as the Spanish began to take control of land and resources.\n\nThe indigenous people resisted Spanish rule for several decades, but eventually they were defeated in a series of wars and forced to sign treaties that gave Spain control over their lands. The Guarani were forced to work on Spanish farms and plantations, while the Guaraní were enslaved and forced into labor camps. This led to widespread resentment among both groups, which eventually erupted into open rebellion in 1811.\n\nThe rebellion was led by José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who became known as \"the Liberator.\" He led a guerrilla war against the Spanish for several years, eventually gaining support from other indigenous groups and even some Spanish settlers. In 1816, he declared independence for Paraguay from Spain and established a new government based on a constitution that guaranteed rights for all citizens regardless of race or religion.\n\nHowever, the new government was unstable and soon faced challenges from neighboring countries. In 1864, Brazil invaded Paraguay and occupied parts of its territory for several years. During this time, Paraguayans fought a guerilla war against Brazilian forces until they were eventually defeated in 1870.\n\nAfter this defeat, Paraguay entered into a period of political instability and economic decline that lasted until the early 20th century. During this time, there were several military coups and changes in government leadership. The country's economy also suffered from poor management and corruption.\n\nIn 1936, General Alfredo Stroessner seized power in a coup d'état and ruled Paraguay as a dictator until his death in 2006. During his rule, Stroessner implemented policies that favored wealthy landowners at the expense of poorer citizens. He also maintained close ties with Argentina and Brazil, which helped him maintain power despite international condemnation of his human rights record.\n\nToday, Paraguay is a democratic country with a multi-party system of government. It has experienced economic growth in recent years due to increased agricultural production and exports of soybeans and other crops. However, poverty remains a major issue for many Paraguayans, especially those living in rural areas. The country also faces challenges related to environmental degradation and climate change due to deforestation and agricultural practices that have depleted soil nutrients over time.\n\nIn conclusion, Paraguay's history is complex and multifaceted, with many different cultures and peoples contributing to its development over time. The country has experienced periods of both prosperity and hardship due to political instability, economic decline, military coups, environmental degradation, and other challenges related to its geography and climate conditions. Despite these challenges, Paraguay continues to strive towards a better future for its people through democratic governance, economic growth, environmental protection efforts, and other initiatives aimed at improving quality of life for all citizens.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called \"The Giant Province of the Indies\", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups.", "secs": 0.2934423740953207, "reference": "पराग्वे, जिसे पहले “इंडीज का विशाल प्रांत” कहा जाता था उसका जन्म 16वीं शताब्दी में, स्वदेशी समूहों के साथ स्पेनिश विजेताओं की मुठभेड़ की वजह से हुआ था."}

During this time, there were many peaceful protests and demonstrations against the colonial rule. However, on 11 August 1925, a peaceful gathering in Apia resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III. This event is considered to be a turning point in the history of Samoa and led to increased tensions between the Samoan people and the colonial government.\n\nThe killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III is seen as a symbol of oppression and injustice by the colonial government. It also marked a shift in the relationship between the Samoan people and their colonial rulers. The Mau movement was a significant event in Samoa's history and led to many changes in the country, including self-government and independence from New Zealand.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "During the struggle for independence organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.", "secs": 0.27294177934527397, "reference": "माऊ आंदोलन द्वारा स्वतंत्रता के लिए आयोजित संघर्ष के दौरान, नगर में एक शांतिपूर्ण सभा में प्रमुख तापुआ तामासेसे सेलोफ़ी तृतीय की हत्या हो गई."}

It is located in the Sentinel Range of Antarctica, which is part of the Transantarctic Mountains. The Vinson Massif is a glaciated mountain with a peak elevation of 4,892 meters (16,050 ft) above sea level. It is also the highest mountain in the world that is not on land.\n\nThe Vinson Massif is named after Sir Douglas Mawson, an Australian explorer and geologist who led an expedition to Antarctica in 1911–1914. During this expedition, he discovered the Vinson Massif and named it after himself. The Vinson Massif was first climbed in 1966 by a team led by American climber Jim Wickwire. Since then, it has been climbed several times by various teams from around the world.\n\nThe Vinson Massif is a popular destination for mountaineers and climbers from around the world. It offers a challenging and rewarding climbing experience for experienced mountaineers and is considered one of the most difficult climbs in Antarctica. The route to the summit involves traversing steep glaciers and negotiating crevasses, making it a challenging and dangerous climb. However, the stunning views from the summit make it all worth it for those who reach the top.\n\nThe Vinson Massif is also an important scientific site for researchers studying climate change and glaciology. The massif provides a unique opportunity to study how glaciers are responding to climate change in Antarctica, as they are one of the few places where long-term data on glacier movement and mass balance can be collected. This information is crucial for understanding how climate change is affecting glaciers around the world, including those in other parts of Antarctica.\n\nIn conclusion, the Vinson Massif is a remarkable natural wonder that offers a challenging and rewarding climbing experience for experienced mountaineers.
