A great singer's voice is going to be loud, as they need to project their voice to be heard by an audience. George Michael's voice was known for its power and range, and he was considered one of the greatest singers of his generation. Sound is a general term that can refer to the quality or pitch of a sound, but in this context it is likely referring to the volume of a sound. Beautiful is a subjective term that can mean different things to different people, but in this context it is likely referring to the aesthetic qualities of a sound, such as its timbre or tone. Communicating is also a general term that can refer to the ability of a sound to convey information or emotion, but in this context it is likely referring to the ability of a singer's voice to communicate with an audience.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: You will be presented with a question that has multiple possible answers.

It can be a difficult and painful experience, and it can have a significant impact on mental health and well-being.\n\nThe other options are not correct because they do not address the negative effect to someone other than a spouse when two spouses are getting divorced. \"Lose money\" does not address the negative effect to someone other than a spouse when two spouses are getting divorced, as divorce can be expensive and can involve financial losses for both spouses. \"Children suffer\" does not address the negative effect to someone other than a spouse when two spouses are getting divorced, as children may suffer emotionally and financially from their parents' divorce. \"Depression\" does not address the negative effect to someone other than a spouse when two spouses are getting divorced, as depression can be caused by many factors, including divorce. \"No spouse\" does not address the negative effect to someone other than a spouse when two spouses are getting divorced, as one spouse will still have a spouse after divorce.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"A\", which addresses the negative effect to someone other than a spouse when two spouses are getting divorced, which is grief.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "### Human: You will be presented with a question that has multiple possible answers.

However, it is important to note that rest areas can be busy and may not always be available when you need them.\n\nIf you need to use the restroom urgently, it may be better to stop at a gas station or office building, as they are more likely to have restrooms available.
