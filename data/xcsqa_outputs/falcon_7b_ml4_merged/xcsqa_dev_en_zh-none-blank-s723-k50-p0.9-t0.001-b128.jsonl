A ruler is expected to have a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of their realm, and to be responsible for ensuring that it functions effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn contrast, \"B\" is not a suitable answer because it does not accurately reflect the scope of a ruler's responsibilities. A ruler is not responsible for running a football match or a classroom, as these are specific tasks that are typically performed by other individuals or entities.\n\nSimilarly, \"C\" is not a suitable answer because it does not accurately reflect the scope of a ruler's responsibilities. A ruler is not responsible for teaching students about various subjects, as this is typically the responsibility of educators or other experts in their field.\n\nFinally, \"D\" and \"E\" are not suitable answers because they do not accurately reflect the scope of a ruler's responsibilities.

The ocean is also very wet, as it contains over 97% of the Earth's water supply. Additionally, the ocean is very wide and covers a large area of land, making it a vast and diverse ecosystem.\n\nThe answer \"B\" is incorrect because the ocean is not very deep. The deepest point in the ocean is the Mariana Trench, which is located in the western Pacific Ocean. The ocean is not very wet, as it contains only about 1% of the Earth's water supply.\n\nThe answer \"C\" is incorrect because the ocean is not very wide. The ocean covers a large area of land, but it is not as wide as some other bodies of water such as lakes or rivers.\n\nThe answer \"D\" is incorrect because the ocean does not have a high salt content. The ocean has a salinity level that ranges from about 3% to 3.5%, which is relatively low compared to other bodies of water such as lakes or rivers.\n\nThe answer \"E\" is incorrect because pressure does not play a significant role in determining the diversity of life in the ocean.
