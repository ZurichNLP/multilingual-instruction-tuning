{"prompt":"### Human: Why does warmth make you feel tired?### Assistant:","system":"Warmth is associated with a chemical called serotonin, which is a hormone that affects your mood, appetite, sleep, and other functions. Warmth can stimulate the release of serotonin, which can make you feel tired and sleepy.\n\nThe body has an internal temperature control system that helps regulate body temperature. When the body is exposed to warmth, it responds by increasing blood flow to the skin to help dissipate heat. This increase in blood flow can also cause a decrease in blood flow to other parts of the body, including the brain. This decrease in blood flow can lead to drowsiness and sleepiness.\n\nIn addition, warmth can also cause changes in your heart rate and breathing rate, which can also contribute to tiredness.\n\nSo overall, warmth can make you feel tired because it causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain and other parts of the body, which can lead to a decrease in energy levels.","finish_reason":"stop","source":"Why does warmth make you feel tired?","secs":0.766299516,"source_lang":"eng_Latn","system_lang":"eng_Latn","id":193,"gpt-3.5-turbo-judgement":"Excellent","gpt-3.5-turbo-justification":"informative, interesting","gpt-3.5-turbo-cost":0.00086}

Similarly, others may blink less frequently due to environmental factors such as prolonged periods of staring at screens or intense visual activity.\n\nTherefore, it is difficult to provide an exact number for the average number of blinks per lifetime without considering these individual factors.

{"prompt":"### Human: What do the different octane values of gasoline mean?### Assistant:","system":"The octane rating of gasoline is a measure of its ability to resist ignition. The higher the octane rating, the more resistant the fuel is to detonation or knocking. This is important because knocking can cause engine damage and reduce performance.\n\nThe octane rating system was developed by scientists who discovered that a mixture of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane and 1,1,3-trimethylbutane had the highest resistance to knocking compared to other fuel mixtures. The number assigned to each fuel mixture was based on the amount of trimethylpentane and trimethylbutane it contained. This led to the creation of a rating system that assigned numbers to different fuel mixtures based on their resistance to knocking.\n\nToday, octane ratings are used to indicate the quality of gasoline and are usually found on gas pumps. The octane rating scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating higher quality gasoline. For example, regular gasoline typically has an octane rating of 87, mid-grade gasoline has an octane rating of 89, and premium gasoline has an octane rating of 91 or higher.\n\nThe importance of octane ratings can be seen in high-performance engines that require high-octane fuel to prevent knocking and maximize engine power output. However, using higher-octane fuels in low-performance engines can actually reduce efficiency and increase emissions, so it's important to use the correct octane rating for your vehicle's engine type and specifications.","finish_reason":"stop","source":"What do the different octane values of gasoline mean?","secs":0.9575394392,"source_lang":"eng_Latn","system_lang":"eng_Latn","id":79,"gpt-3.5-turbo-judgement":"Excellent","gpt-3.5-turbo-justification":"informative, interesting","gpt-3.5-turbo-cost":0.0010415}

IGF-1 is a polypeptide hormone that binds to the IGF-1 receptor on the ER, which then triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the release of Ca2+ ions into the cytosol.
