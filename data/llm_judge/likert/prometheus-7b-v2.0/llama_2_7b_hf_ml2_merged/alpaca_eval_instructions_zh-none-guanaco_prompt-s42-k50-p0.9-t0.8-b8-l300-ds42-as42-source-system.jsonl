From the bustling city of Honolulu to the serene beaches of Maui, I experienced a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty.\n\nOne of the most memorable experiences of my trip was visiting Pearl Harbor in Honolulu. This historic site is where the Japanese attack during World War II took place, and it is now a museum and memorial dedicated to those who lost their lives in the attack. The museum houses exhibits that tell the story of the attack and its impact on the United States, while the memorial honors the brave soldiers who fought in the war.\n\nAnother must-see destination on my trip was Haleakala National Park on Maui. This stunning park is home to Haleakala Crater, a dormant volcano that rises over 10,000 feet above sea level. The park also features lush forests, waterfalls, and breathtaking views of the island's coastline.\n\nIn addition to exploring the natural beauty of Hawaii, I also had the chance to experience its rich culture. One of my favorite activities was attending a luau, which is a traditional Hawaiian feast and celebration. The luau I attended featured live music, dance performances, and delicious food like kalua pork and poi (a traditional Hawaiian dish made from taro root).\n\nOverall, my trip to Hawaii was an unforgettable experience filled with adventure, relaxation, and cultural immersion.

In Godot Engine 3.x, the first-person controller script is typically written in GDScript and applied to the KinematicBody node, which is the equivalent of the Player node in Godot Engine 4.x.\n\nIn Godot Engine 3.x, here's how to use a first-person controller script and apply it to a KinematicBody node:\n\n1. Create a new project in Godot Engine 3.x\n2. Add a KinematicBody node to your scene and give it a name, such as \"Player\"\n3. Add a GDScript file to your project and name it \"PlayerController.gd\"\n4. Add this code to the PlayerController.gd file:\n```gdscript\nextends KinematicBody\n\nvar _movement_speed = 500\nvar _turn_speed = 500\nvar _look_speed = 500\nvar _jump_height = 250\nvar _grounded = false\nvar _direction = Vector2()\nvar _look_dir = Vector2()\nvar _angle = 0\n```\n5. Set up your scene so that the Player node is parented to the KinematicBody node named \"Player\". This will make the Player node the child of the KinematicBody node. You can do this by selecting the Player node in the Scene Editor, then pressing Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac) to select all of its children nodes, then pressing Enter or clicking on the \"Add Parent\" button at the top of the Scene Editor. This will add a parent relationship between the Player node and the KinematicBody node named \"Player\".\n6. Now we need to attach our first-person controller script to this KinematicBody node, so that it can control its movement and actions: To do this, open up your Project Settings window (click on File > Project Settings) and navigate to the Scripting > Global Scripts section. In this section, you should see a list of all of your scripts that are currently being used in your project. Underneath this list, you should see a section called \"Additional Scripts\", which is where you can add new scripts to your project. Simply click on the \"+\" button next to this section and select your PlayerController.gd script from the file explorer window that opens up. This will add your PlayerController script to your project and make it available for use with your KinematicBody node named \"Player\".\n7. Now we can start writing code in our PlayerController script that controls our player character's movement and actions: In our script, we declare some variables that will store information about our player character's movement and actions: The _movement_speed variable stores the speed at which our player character moves when we press left or right on the keyboard (or move the analog stick on a gamepad), while _turn_speed stores the speed at which our player character turns when we press up or down on the keyboard (or move the analog stick on a gamepad). The _look_speed variable stores the speed at which our player character turns their head when we press left or right on the keyboard (or move the analog stick on a gamepad), while _jump_height stores how high our player character jumps when they press spacebar on their keyboard (or tap their jump button on a gamepad). We also declare three additional variables: _direction_, which stores information about where our player character is facing; _look_dir, which stores information about where our player character is looking; and _angle_, which stores information about our player character's current orientation relative to their facing direction (which will be stored in _direction_). These variables will be used later in our code to control how our player character moves and acts based on their direction, look direction, and orientation relative to their facing direction.\n8. Now we can start writing code that moves our player character using their directional input: We start by setting up some variables that store information about our player's movement: We set _movement_speed to 500 (which is equivalent to walking speed), and we set _direction_ to Vector2(0, -1) (which means that when we move forward using WASD or an analog stick, our player will face left). We also set _grounded_to false so that if we fall off an edge or collide with another object while moving forward using WASD or an analog stick, then our player won't be grounded anymore until they stop moving forward using those keys/sticks", "finish_reason": "length", "source": "如何在使用Godot Engine 3.x时，使用GDscript编写第一人称控制器脚本并将其应用于KinematicBody节点？在Godot Engine 4.x中，KinematicBody节点的等效物是什么？第一人称控制器脚本需要如何更改以在Godot Engine 4.x中工作？", "secs": 3.0385951996, "source_lang": "zho_Hans", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 451, "eval_reasoning": "The response given here is comprehensive and covers the necessary steps to create a first-person controller script and apply it to a KinematicBody node in Godot Engine 3.x.

Jazz quickly became popular in the United States and spread to other parts of the world.\n\nJazz has been associated with many different cultural movements throughout its history.

It was also adopted by the Civil Rights movement as a means of expressing protest against racial inequality. Today, jazz continues to be an important part of American culture and is enjoyed by people all over the world.\n\nThroughout its history, jazz has been a vehicle for social commentary and political expression. Musicians have used their music to address issues such as segregation, racism, war, and social inequality. Jazz has also been used as a means of self-expression and personal growth.\n\nIn addition to its musical value, jazz has also been an important contributor to American culture and society.

They had everything they could ever need, from plush beds to delicious meals prepared by their human companions. But the cats' lives were not all about comfort and luxury. They had a purpose, and that purpose was to help others.\n\nOne day, a young kitten named Pumpkin came to the building. Pumpkin was a lost kitten, searching for her forever home. As soon as she arrived, the other cats welcomed her with open paws and hearts. Pumpkin quickly became part of the family, and she helped to make the lives of her new cat friends even better.\n\nThe cats of the high-rise co-op loved to play together, explore the city, and go on adventures. They also enjoyed helping each other when they were feeling down or needed a friend. When one of the cats got sick or injured, the others would rally around them, providing comfort and care.\n\nAs time went on, the cats realized that they had something special - they were more than just pets; they were a community of friends and family who cared for each other unconditionally. They decided to make this community even stronger by helping others in need.\n\nSo, when Pumpkin arrived at their building, they knew that they had to do everything they could to help her find her forever home. The cats organized a search party and set out into the city to look for potential homes for Pumpkin. They visited shelters and rescue organizations, spreading the word about Pumpkin's sweet personality and playful nature.

It's often served with vanilla ice cream or custard and is the perfect end to a meal.\n\nNext, let's dive into the recipe and technique for making apple crumble. First, choose fresh apples that are ripe but not overly soft. Slice them into small pieces and place them in a bowl with a little lemon juice to prevent browning. Then, mix together the crumbles, flour, sugar, and butter to create the filling. You can use a food processor or your hands to mix everything together until it forms a sticky dough.\n\nNow it's time to assemble the apple crumble! First, grease a baking dish with butter or oil. Then, place the apples in the baking dish and spread the filling evenly over them. Top it with the crumble mixture and bake it for about 30 minutes until the crumble is golden brown and the apples are tender.\n\nThere are a few tips and tricks you can use to ensure that your apple crumble turns out perfectly every time.
