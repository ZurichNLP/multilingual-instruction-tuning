Detta kan ske genom att sänka energiförbrukningen och byta till mer miljövänliga energi- och bilprodukter.\n\nDet är också viktigt att begränsa utandningen av andra klimatspelande växthusgaser som metan och svavelväte. Detta kan ske genom att anpassa jordbruksmetoder och minska odling av sådana odlingsmetoder som drabbar de klimatstabiliserande träden, samt genom att begränsa koldioxidutsläppen från jordbrukssektorn.\n\nDet är också viktigt att investera i energikälla och teknik som kan lösa problemen med energiförsörjningen och utvinna energi i ett miljövänligare sätt. Detta inkluderar solceller, vindkraft, havstryck, kraftavloppssystem och andra tekniker.\n\nDet är också viktigt att begränsa koldioxidutslippen från flygning och transporter, genom att använda hållbara transportmedel och minska resandet.\n\nEn annan viktig åtgärd för att begränsa den globala uppvärmningen är att arbeta för en miljövänligare ekonomi. Detta innefattar bland annat försöka få ett ökat utrymme för miljöfokuserad ekonomisk utveckling, begränsa finansiella investeringar i olja och kolutvinning, samt arbeta för att begränsa ekonomiska påtryckningar på naturresurser som jordbruksmark.\n\nSom en allmän regel bör allt vi gör för att begränsa den globala uppvärmningen vara så pass miljövänligt som möjligt, då detta kommer leda till mindre avtryck på den globala uppvärmningen överallt i världen.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "\"eru drekar raunverulega til?\"", "secs": 1.8124798536000002, "source_lang": "isl_Latn", "system_lang": "swe_Latn", "source_en": "does the dinosaurs really exist?", "id": 118, "system_en": "\"Is there a real way to act?\" can be interpreted as \"what is the right way to act to reduce global warming?\" There are several different ways to act to reduce global warming.\n\nAccording to some climate researchers, one of the most important measures to limit global warming may be to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and car traffic. This can be achieved by reducing energy consumption and switching to more environmentally friendly energy and car products.\n\nIt is also important to limit the release of other climate-impacting greenhouse gases such as methane and hydrogen sulfide. This can be done by adapting agricultural methods and reducing the cultivation of practices that affect climate-stabilizing trees, as well as by limiting carbon dioxide emissions from the agricultural sector.\n\nIt is also important to invest in energy sources and technology that can solve the problems of energy supply and extract energy in a more environmentally friendly way. This includes solar cells, wind power, ocean pressure, power drainage systems, and other technologies.\n\nIt is also important to limit carbon dioxide emissions from flying and transportation by using sustainable means of transport and reducing travel.\n\nAnother important measure to limit global warming is to work towards a more environmentally friendly economy. This includes, among other things, trying to create more space for environmentally focused economic development, limiting financial investments in oil and coal mining, and working to limit economic pressures on natural resources such as agricultural land.\n\nAs a general rule, everything we do to limit global warming should be as environmentally friendly as possible, as this will lead to less impact on global warming everywhere in the world.", "translation_meta": {"system_fingerprint": null, "prompt_tokens": 680, "completion_tokens": 310, "cost": 0.0013000000000000002, "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106"}, "eval_reasoning": "The provided response is completely irrelevant to the user's question about whether dinosaurs exist.

Það hefur verið fullyrt að gullhlutfallið hafi verið notað í fornri list og byggingarlist, en án áreiðanlegra heimilda. Á ítölsku endurreisnartímanum skrifaði Luca Pacioli áhrifamikla ritgerðina De divina proportione (1509), sem var myndað með trésnittum eftir Leonardo da Vinci, um notkun gullhlutfallsins í list. Annað ítölskt málverk, Piero della Francesca, þróaði hugmyndir Evklíðs um sjónarhorn í ritgerðum eins og De Prospectiva Pingendi og í málverkum sínum. Íslenskur grafískur listamaður, M. C. Escher, notaði mikið af flísun og hýperbólskri rúmfræði með aðstoð stærðfræðingsins H. S. M. Coxeter, en hreyfingin De Stijl sem Theo van Doesburg og Piet Mondrian stóðu fyrir, lagði áherslu á rúmfræðilegar mynstur. Stærðfræði hefur haft áhrif á textíllist eins og teppasmíði, prjónun, krosssteik, hekl, útsaum, vefnað og tæppergerð, svo og kilim.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "id": 571, "system_en": "Especially, mathematics has been used in art.
