Here, we can reduce 5x^3 - 2x + 3 to a power form:\n\nf(x) = (5x^2 - 2x)^2 + 6x + 9\n\nThe power form yields the second-order derivative:\n\nf'(x) = (10x - 4)(5x^2 - 2x) + (2)(5x^2 - 2x)^2 + (6)(5x^2 - 2x)\n\nFor the interval [a, b] defined by the function, we obtain:\n\nf'(a) = (10a - 4)(5a^2 - 2a) + (2)(5a^2 - 2a)^2 + (6)(5a^2 - 2a) = M*0\nf'(b) = (10b - 4)(5b^2 - 2b) + (2)(5b^2 - 2b)^2 + (6)(5b^2 - 2b) = M*0\nwhere M = f(b), b > a\n\nSince f(a) = M*0 and f'(b) = M*0, we obtain: f(b) = M, b > a. Here, we take the values of [a, b] as [1, +∞], with b > a. And since f'(b) = M*0, b > a, when x = a, f(a) < f(b), f(a) < M. Therefore, f(a) < f(b), b > a.\n\nFurthermore, since b > a, for any a < x < b, we have: f'(x) < M, x > a, x > b. So when x > a, x > b, f(x) < f(b), f(x) < M. Here, we take the values of [1, +∞] as [1, b], with b > a. Furthermore, since f'(b) = M*0, we obtain: f(b) = M, b > a. Therefore, when x = b, f(b) < M.\n\nIn summary, we have obtained f(a), f(b), M:\n    f(1) = M,    1 > a     -->   M <= f(1), f(1) <= M.

The background of the poem's creation is Pushkin's personal experience, as his eldest son Ivan Ilyich was mistakenly killed.\n\nThe poem is a short piece, written in a nine-line format with four-six characters. It depicts Pushkin's recollection of his eldest son Ivan Ilyich after adopting his own son. Pushkin recalls the life and death of Ivan Ilyich, summarizing his love and compassion for his eldest son. Finally, Pushkin transforms his thoughts and emotions into a poem to commemorate his eldest son.\n\nIn the poem, Pushkin uses rich symbolism and metaphors to express his thoughts and emotions about his eldest son. For example, he uses abstract images such as \"light,\" \"air,\" and \"emotion\" to describe his feelings towards his son. He also uses colors like \"silver\" and \"gold\" to depict his emotions towards his son. These colors, similar to the images of metal and gems, symbolize Pushkin's loyalty and love for his eldest son, and these emotions become his self-response to the relationship between himself and his son.\n\nIn the poem, Pushkin also uses objects like \"stars\" and \"sky\" to describe his emotions towards his eldest son. These objects symbolize freedom, hope, and peace, representing his ever-changing psychological state after his son's death. These objects also demonstrate Pushkin's hopeful and ever-changing mindset after his son's death.\n\nThe poem includes an inseparable dialogue: \"(I) don't want... (I) don't want...\" This use of repetitive grammar expresses self-response. This language structure reveals Pushkin's psychological state of uncertainty and inability to accept the information of death in his relationship with his son.\n\nFinally, the poem includes a passage representing Pushkin's innermost state and emotions to the world: \"I know you have something to tell me... I know you have something to tell me... I know you have something to tell me...\" This language expression reveals Pushkin's uncertainty and inability to receive information in his inner thoughts, cognition, and emotions.\n\n\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\" is a profound reflection on themes such as life, love, and death, and its content deeply resonates with people of all ages, cultures, and nations.", "translation_meta": {"system_fingerprint": "fp_eeff13170a", "prompt_tokens": 990, "completion_tokens": 478, "cost": 0.0019459999999990002, "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106"}, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a detailed and relevant explanation of the poem 'The Death of Ivan Ilyich' by Alexander Pushkin.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "id": 571, "system_en": "This article mainly introduces the relationship between mathematics and art, especially in the application in visual arts.\n\nFrom the \"Canon\" by the Greek sculptor Polyclitus in the 4th century AD to the works and paintings of Italian painters Luca Pacioli's \"Divine Proportion\" in 1509 and Piero della Francesca's \"Perspective Drawing Theory\" in 1509, as well as the frequent references to mathematics in the works of the British printmaker Albrecht Dürer in his work \"Melancholy I\" in 1840, and the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian, all deeply understand the influence of mathematics on visual arts. In addition to these examples, mathematics also influences textile arts, such as patchwork, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, and blankets made in Turkey and other regions.

This will help students learn and assess their achievements at two different levels.\n\nAbout CEFR: CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) is an international framework used to standardize language education courses. It was initiated by European education departments and international organizations with the aim of improving the language proficiency of Europeans in foreign language communication.\n\nCEFR consists of four basic levels: A1, A2, B1, B2. Each level has a standardized criterion for measuring students' language proficiency. A1 level is a beginner level, and B2 level is an advanced level. Between these two levels, there is also the B1 level. These levels are used in education to measure students' language proficiency.\n\nAbout course design: To design a course on the theme of friendship, two different courses can be designed based on the CEFR A1 and A2 standards. Here are some suggestions:\n\nCourse A1: This course mainly introduces the basic knowledge and concepts of the theme of friendship. For example, students will learn what friendship is, what friendliness is, what mutual understanding is, and what community is. Students will also learn about the manifestations and meanings of friendship in different cultures. These contents can be presented and taught through materials, charts, videos, etc. In addition, the course can also include activities such as reading articles, writing assignments, and oral presentations for learning and testing.\n\nCourse A2: This course will delve into more content and concepts of the theme of friendship. For example, students will learn what communication is, what problem-solving is, and what communication methods are. They will also learn about the manifestations and meanings of friendship in different age groups and genders. In addition, the course can include more reading articles, writing assignments, and oral presentations for learning and testing. Furthermore, the course can also include travel or community service projects to enhance students' understanding and relationships with the community and other human beings.\n\nAbout assessment criteria: To measure students' achievements in CEFR A1 and A2, standardized testing criteria from these two levels can be used for measurement. For example, the A1 level includes Speaking, Reading, and Writing tests, while the A2 level includes Speaking, Reading, and Listening tests. Each test has its own scoring system, which can be used to compare and determine success or failure based on students' scores in each test.
