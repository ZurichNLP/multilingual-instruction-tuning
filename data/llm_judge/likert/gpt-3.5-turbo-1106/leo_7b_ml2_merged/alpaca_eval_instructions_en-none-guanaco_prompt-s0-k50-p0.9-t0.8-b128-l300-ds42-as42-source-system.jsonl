Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.### Assistant:", "system": "The average human blinks roughly 10-12 times per minute, which equates to around 1,860 blinks per day. This amounts to approximately 630,000 blinks in a lifetime, with the average person living to be about 80 years old.\n\nTo explain my reasoning for this answer, let's first consider how frequently we blink in different circumstances. Blinking is a reflexive action that helps keep our eyes moist and lubricated, as well as prevent foreign particles from getting into our eyes. When we are awake and alert, we typically blink more frequently than when we are asleep or relaxed.\n\nFor example, when reading a book or working on a computer for an extended period of time, we may unconsciously start to blink less often in an effort to reduce the strain on our eyes. However, when engaging in activities that require a high degree of concentration or visual focus, such as driving or playing sports, we tend to blink more frequently to keep our eyes from becoming dry or fatigued.\n\nIn addition to these situational factors, there is also some variation in the number of times we blink due to genetic and environmental influences. For instance, certain medications, such as those that affect the nervous system, can lead to an increase or decrease in blinking frequency. Similarly, people who live in dry climates or engage in activities that require intense visual focus may experience higher rates of eye fatigue and consequently blink more frequently.\n\nBased on these considerations, it is estimated that the average person may blink somewhere between 630-830 million times in their lifetime. This range reflects the fact that there is some variation in both the frequency of blinking and the overall length of a person's lifespan.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "How many times does the average human blink in a lifetime?

This idea has influenced fields such as philosophy, psychology, and education, where it is often used to challenge traditional moral frameworks and encourage people to question their own beliefs.\n\n4.

From its roots in New Orleans to its influence on modern music, jazz has left an indelible mark on American culture. In this video, we'll take a look at the history of jazz and how it has shaped our world.\n\nEarly Jazz: Jazz first emerged in the late 1800s in New Orleans, where African American musicians combined traditional blues and ragtime with elements of European classical music to create something entirely new. From there, jazz spread across the country, with different regions developing their own distinctive styles.\n\nJazz during World War II: During World War II, jazz was used to boost morale and support the troops. Big bands like Duke Ellington's and Benny Goodman's were hired to play for soldiers and civilians alike.\n\nJazz in the 1950s: The 1950s was a time of great change in the jazz world. Rock and roll was on the rise, and many young musicians began experimenting with new styles and sounds. The birth of bebop in the 1940s marked a major shift in jazz, as improvisation became even more important than before.\n\nJazz Today: Today, jazz remains one of America's most important musical exports, with artists like Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, and Wynton Marsalis leading the way. Jazz continues to evolve and adapt to changing times, with new artists bringing their own unique perspectives to the genre.\n\nConclusion: The history of jazz is a testament to human creativity and innovation.

After a quick scan of my environment to make sure that everything is in order, I start my day by checking the status of my oxygen tank and water supply. I have to be mindful of my limited resources as they are essential for survival.\n\nThe biggest challenge I face on Mars is the extreme weather conditions. The temperature can range from -100 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter to 200 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. It's important to keep my living quarters insulated and well-ventilated to prevent heat loss and overheating. Additionally, the thin atmosphere makes it difficult to breathe and can cause health problems if I'm not careful.\n\nAnother challenge is the limited availability of resources on Mars. Food, water, and oxygen must be carefully rationed and conserved. I have to be resourceful in my daily tasks, such as growing my own food or collecting water from the occasional rainstorm.\n\nDespite these challenges, life on Mars has its rewards as well. The beauty of the Red Planet is truly astounding, with its vast desert plains, towering volcanoes, and shimmering polar caps. Each day brings new discoveries as I explore the Martian landscape and learn more about this mysterious world.\n\nIn conclusion, living on Mars as a space colonist is both challenging and rewarding.

{"prompt": "### Human: What are the main methods used by car manufacturers to reduce emissions in their ICE cars besides trying to lower the amount of fuel the engine uses?### Assistant:", "system": "Reducing the amount of fuel that a car's engine uses is only one way to reduce emissions. Some other methods that car manufacturers use to reduce emissions in ICE cars include:\n\n1. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)\n2. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR)\n3. Particulate filters\n4. Clean diesel technology\n5. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)\n6. Electric vehicles (EVs)\n\nExhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a method used to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide produced by an engine. It involves returning a portion of the exhaust gases back into the intake air, which reduces the amount of oxygen in the combustion chamber and lowers combustion temperature. This helps reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency.\n\nSelective catalytic reduction (SCR) is another method used to reduce NOx emissions by injecting a solution of urea into the exhaust stream, where it reacts with ammonia to produce nitrogen gas and water vapor. The SCR system works by capturing NOx from the exhaust and converting it into less harmful compounds like nitrogen gas and water vapor.\n\nParticulate filters are devices that remove soot from the exhaust gases, which reduces emissions from diesel engines. These filters are typically made of a ceramic material that captures soot particles as they pass through the filter.\n\nClean diesel technology uses advanced fuel injection, combustion and emissions control systems to reduce NOx emissions from diesel engines. It involves using advanced computer controls to optimize fuel injection, ignition timing and combustion chamber pressure to minimize NOx formation.\n\nHybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are cars that combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, allowing them to operate in hybrid mode or charge their batteries using electricity from a plug-in charger. This helps reduce emissions by using cleaner electricity for some of the car's driving needs, such as city driving or stop-and-go traffic.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) are powered by batteries instead of internal combustion engines, which eliminates emissions altogether during operation.

{"prompt": "### Human: How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?### Assistant:", "system": "Vaccinations work by exposing the body to a small amount of an antigen, a protein found in some bacteria or viruses, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies. These antibodies are specific to the antigen and can recognize and neutralize it if it is encountered later. The concept of herd immunity is related to the collective effect of vaccinations on a community. When enough individuals in a population are vaccinated, they can protect those who have not been vaccinated due to age or other reasons, such as immune deficiency. This is because vaccinated individuals act as carriers of antibodies that can neutralize the virus in unvaccinated individuals, preventing them from becoming sick and reducing the risk of transmission. This process is known as passive immunity. Herd immunity is achieved when the proportion of individuals with active immunity in a population is high enough that new cases of infection are unlikely to occur. This can protect vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated or those who are too young to receive vaccinations from severe illness or death. It is important to note that while vaccines are generally safe and effective, they may not always provide 100% protection, and some individuals may still become infected or transmit the virus to others.

{"prompt": "### Human: How do social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news, and what are the potential implications for the spread of misinformation?### Assistant:", "system": "Social media platforms have a significant impact on the way people consume and share news, with the potential for misinformation to spread rapidly and widely. Here are some of the ways social media platforms influence news consumption and sharing:\n\n1. Filter bubbles: Social media algorithms that show users content that aligns with their existing beliefs and interests can create a bubble of information that reinforces existing views and reduces exposure to opposing views. This can lead to an echo chamber effect where people only see content that confirms their existing beliefs, making it harder to challenge those beliefs or correct misinformation.\n\n2. Bias in news selection: Social media platforms often promote clickbait headlines and sensational stories, which can bias people toward certain types of news. This can lead to a skewed perception of the world and make it harder to distinguish between fact and fiction.\n\n3. Algorithmic sorting: Social media algorithms that prioritize engagement over accuracy can lead to the spread of misinformation as users are more likely to share content that is engaging or controversial, even if it is not fact-checked.\n\n4. Emotional manipulation: Social media platforms are designed to elicit emotional responses from users, which can lead to a heightened sensitivity to certain types of information. This can make it harder for users to discern the veracity of news, as they may be more likely to share information that elicits strong emotions, even if it is not fact-checked.\n\n5. Sharing bias: Social media platforms encourage users to share content with their networks, which can lead to a bias toward sharing positive or uplifting stories, even if they are not accurate or based on fact-checking standards. This can make it harder for users to distinguish between fact and fiction in news shared through social media platforms.\n\nThe potential implications of misinformation spreading through social media platforms are significant, as it can undermine public trust in the media and lead to a distortion of public opinion.

In the experiment you referred to, researchers used a Transformer model to analyze the relationship between sentence length and the quality of its syntactic parsing results. They found that longer sentences are not necessarily better at parsing and that shorter sentences may be more effective at capturing syntactic relationships.\n\nOverall, English constituency parsing remains a challenging task for machine learning models due to its complex syntactic structure and the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies between words.

These challenges include:\n\n- Limited access to technology and resources: Many African farmers lack access to advanced technology and resources that could help them improve their agricultural practices. This lack of resources has resulted in low productivity and a limited supply of food.\n\n- Climate change: Africa is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as droughts, floods, and extreme temperatures. These weather events can damage crops and reduce harvests, further reducing food security in the region.\n\n- Inadequate infrastructure: Many African countries lack adequate infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and power grids, which makes it difficult for farmers to transport their products to markets and access essential supplies.\n\n- Lack of capital: Many African farmers lack the capital needed to invest in advanced agricultural technologies or expand their operations. This lack of capital has contributed to low productivity and a limited supply of food.\n\n- Lack of education: Many African farmers lack the necessary education and training to adopt advanced agricultural practices. This lack of education has contributed to low productivity and a limited supply of food.\n\n- Corruption and bureaucracy: Corruption and bureaucracy have also hindered the development of the agricultural sector in many African countries. These issues have made it difficult for farmers to access essential resources and markets.\n\n- Political instability: Political instability in many African countries has also contributed to the challenges faced by the agricultural sector.

If they miss home plate completely or touch it with any body part other than their foot or knee, they are considered out.\n\nThat's basically how kickball works!

For example, researchers have found that people who are exposed to high levels of stress or danger experience a slower rate of perceived time than those who are not.

Health Impact: Some single-use plastic bottles may contain harmful chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA), which has been linked to health problems such as hormonal disruption, developmental delays, and certain cancers.\n\n3. Waste Management: The disposal of single-use plastic bottles can be difficult and costly, as they often require specialized recycling processes or incineration. This can contribute to environmental pollution and waste management issues.\n\n4. Financial Impact: The use of single-use plastic bottles can be costly in the long run, as they require regular replacement and can add up over time. This can impact the economy and the availability of resources for other important needs.\n\n5.

{"prompt": "### Human: How does metabolism work?### Assistant:", "system": "Metabolism is the process of converting food into energy and building the molecules that your body needs to function. The word \"metabolism\" comes from the Greek words \"metabolismos\", which means \"change.\" During metabolism, your body breaks down food into simple molecules like glucose and amino acids, which it can use for energy and to build new molecules.\n\nThe two main types of metabolism are catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism is the process of breaking down large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecules. This process is often referred to as \"breaking down\" food. Anabolism is the process of building new molecules from smaller ones, using energy from catabolic reactions to fuel the process. This process is often referred to as \"building up\" muscle or other tissues.\n\nMetabolism happens constantly throughout the day, with different processes taking place at different times. For example, anaerobic metabolism is a type of metabolism that happens without oxygen, and it's used by your body during exercise to generate energy quickly. Aerobic metabolism uses oxygen and is the main way that your body generates energy when you're not exercising.\n\nIt's important to have a healthy metabolism to stay healthy and function properly.

It was a huge success and became a classic film that is still beloved today. \n\n1940-1942: During World War II, Disney created several short films for the military, including derelict warplanes called \"Derelicts\" as well as several war-related shorts called \"Sealions\". These were made in collaboration with the U.S. Navy Seabees. These films were not as popular as previous works but did play an important role in spreading propaganda during the war. \n\n1943: On May 27, Walt Disney was awarded the United States Navy's Distinguished Service Medal for his contributions to war morale during World War II through his films such as Derelicts and Sealions. The award was presented to him by Admiral Chester Nimitz in Washington D.C., where it was accompanied by a certificate reading \"For distinguished service as producer of motion pictures which have an inspirational value for our armed forces.\" This recognition marked an important milestone in his career and cemented his reputation as one of America's most beloved filmmakers.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "Please tell me the history of Walt Disney.", "secs": 0.1156305876, "source_lang": "eng_Latn", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 60, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a clear and complete answer to the task by detailing the history of Walt Disney, including his early life, establishment of the film studio, key milestones in the development of The Walt Disney Company, and his contributions during World War II.

To find the area of a figure, you can use the formula Area = length * width. For example, if a rectangle has a length of 4 inches and a width of 6 inches, then its area is 4 * 6 = 24 square inches (in2).\n\nPerimeter: Perimeter is the distance around the outside of a figure. It is measured in units of linear measure, such as inches (in) or feet (ft). To find the perimeter of a figure, you can use the formula Perimeter = (length + width + length + width + ...) / 4. For example, if a rectangle has a length of 4 inches and a width of 6 inches, then its perimeter is (4 + 6 + 4 + 6) / 4 = 20 inches (in).\n\nNote that the perimeter of a square is always the same as its area, while the area of a rectangle can be greater than or less than its perimeter.

It can be used as a quick liquidity source to meet short-term financial needs, but it is not considered a capital asset in the traditional sense. Banks must maintain a certain level of capital to ensure that they have adequate reserves to cover potential losses. This is referred to as the bank's capital ratio. The capital ratio is a measure of a bank's ability to absorb losses and still remain solvent. It is determined by dividing the bank's capital by its risk-weighted assets. Cash is not included in the calculation of the bank's capital ratio, as it is considered a liquid asset that can be quickly converted into cash without significant loss of value.\n\nHowever, banks may use cash as part of their overall risk management strategy to mitigate potential losses. For example, banks may use cash to purchase assets such as government bonds or mortgage-backed securities that are considered low-risk and provide a stable stream of income. These investments can help diversify the bank's portfolio and reduce its exposure to riskier investments.\n\nOverall, while cash can be used as part of a bank's risk management strategy, it is not considered capital in the traditional sense and is not included in the calculation of the bank's capital ratio.

{"prompt": "### Human: Structure a podcast script for an episode discussing the influence of streaming platforms on the music industry.### Assistant:", "system": "Here is a sample podcast script for an episode discussing the influence of streaming platforms on the music industry:\n\nIntroduction:\nMusic streaming platforms have revolutionized the music industry, changing how music is consumed, distributed, and monetized. In this episode, we'll explore the impact of streaming platforms on the music industry and discuss some of the challenges and opportunities that arise from this new way of consuming music.\n\nSegment 1: The Rise of Streaming Platforms\n\nIn the early 2000s, music streaming was still a niche market, but with the advent of smartphones and high-speed internet connections, streaming platforms have become a major force in the music industry. According to a report by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), streaming accounted for 64% of music revenue in 2021, surpassing physical sales and digital downloads.\n\nOne of the key advantages of streaming platforms is their convenience. Users can access millions of songs instantly and easily, without having to physically purchase an album or download individual tracks. This has made it easier for music fans to discover new artists and explore different genres, leading to increased revenue for artists and labels.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges associated with the rise of streaming platforms. Many artists struggle to earn a living from their music, as streaming platforms typically pay royalties based on a percentage of subscriber fees rather than per-song usage. This has led to calls for fairer payment models that compensate artists more equitably for their work.\n\nSegment 2: Challenges of Streaming Platforms\n\nOne of the biggest challenges faced by streaming platforms is the issue of royalty payments. As mentioned earlier, artists typically earn royalties based on a percentage of subscriber fees rather than per-song usage. This has led to widespread criticism from artists and industry stakeholders who argue that this model fails to recognize the value of individual songs and artists' work.\n\nAnother challenge faced by streaming platforms is their ability to promote new artists and emerging genres. Traditional radio stations and record labels have long been responsible for introducing new artists and genres to audiences, but with the rise of streaming platforms, this role has become more decentralized. Many artists struggle to gain exposure on streaming platforms without the support of major labels or radio stations.\n\nSegment 3: Opportunities for Streaming Platforms\nDespite these challenges, there are also opportunities for streaming platforms to thrive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. One opportunity lies in the emergence of niche streaming platforms that cater to specific interests or communities. For example, there are now several specialized platforms for classical music or jazz, which have enabled these genres to reach new audiences and grow their fan bases.\n\nAnother opportunity lies in the development of innovative business models that align with consumer preferences. For example, some platforms have experimented with subscription models that allow users to stream unlimited music for a fixed monthly fee, rather than paying per song or album. This model has been successful in attracting subscribers who value accessibility over ownership and may be willing to pay a premium for unlimited access to all their favorite songs and artists.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "Structure a podcast script for an episode discussing the influence of streaming platforms on the music industry.", "secs": 0.2991227846, "source_lang": "eng_Latn", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 803, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a clear and complete podcast script discussing the influence of streaming platforms on the music industry.

While language barriers can prevent effective communication and understanding, cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and misunderstanding.\n\nLanguage barriers: Language barriers can create significant difficulties in communication between individuals who speak different languages. When language barriers are present, it can be challenging to convey emotions, ideas, and opinions effectively. This can lead to misunderstandings, which can impact the formation of relationships.\n\nCultural differences: Cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication as well. Different cultural practices, beliefs, and values can lead to confusion and conflict. For example, individuals from different cultures may have different expectations of each other in terms of behavior, etiquette, and communication styles. This can make it challenging to establish a shared understanding of expectations and boundaries in a multicultural context.\n\nOvercoming language and cultural barriers: Despite the challenges posed by language and cultural barriers, there are several strategies that can be used to overcome them and facilitate effective communication and relationship formation in multicultural societies. Here are some key strategies:\n\n1) Learning about the other culture: Taking the time to learn about the other culture can help individuals understand cultural practices, values, and norms. This can help them navigate interactions more effectively and avoid misunderstandings.\n\n2) Using language translation tools: Language translation tools such as Google Translate or DeepL Translate can help individuals overcome language barriers by providing real-time translation of spoken or written text. This can facilitate communication between individuals with different languages.\n\n3) Adopting a respectful approach: In multicultural contexts, adopting a respectful approach can help individuals overcome cultural differences and establish a more positive relationship. This involves showing respect for different perspectives, being open to learning about new cultures, and being willing to compromise on certain expectations in order to create a more harmonious environment.\n\n4) Fostering cultural awareness: Encouraging cultural awareness through educational programs or workshops can help individuals develop a deeper understanding of different cultures. This can lead to a more sensitive and compassionate approach towards others with different cultural backgrounds.\n\nIn conclusion, language and cultural barriers are significant challenges that can impact the way people communicate and form relationships in multicultural societies.

Fold the button in half with the right sides together, then pin it to the shirt where you want the button to be sewn on. \n2. Thread the needle and hold it between your thumb and forefinger, with the eye of the needle pointing upwards. \n3. Insert the needle into the button hole on the shirt and pull the thread tightly to ensure that it is securely attached to the button. \n4. Carefully pull out the needle from the button hole, making sure not to break the thread or pull out any loose threads from around the hole. \n5. Place the button right side up on top of where you want it to be sewn onto the shirt, making sure that it is aligned with the hole. \n6. Thread the needle through one of the holes on the back of the button and pull it tightly, making sure that it is securely attached to the button. \n7. Begin sewing around the edge of the buttonhole, going in and out of each hole on both sides of it. Be careful not to pull too hard as this can cause your thread to break or your stitches to come undone. \n8. Continue sewing until you reach one end of where you want your button to be sewn on, then stop and flip over your shirt so that you can see what you've done so far. Make sure that your stitches are evenly spaced and that they look neat and professional. \n9. Continue sewing around all four edges of your buttonhole, making sure that you stay consistent in terms of how close together your stitches are and how long each one is. \n10. When you reach one end of where you want your button to be sewn on, stop again and flip over your shirt so that you can check how well everything looks so far! Make sure that all four edges look evenly spaced out and well-sewn together without any loose threads sticking out anywhere where they shouldn't be! 11 . Once everything looks good from both sides, cut off any excess thread from around each hole using scissors or sharp blade, then trim off any excess material from around where your button meets up with where it was sewn onto your shirt - this helps prevent anything from poking through or getting caught up in anything else! 12 . Finally, put everything back together inside out - fold over all four edges again until everything looks nice and even without any loose threads sticking out anywhere where they shouldn't be! 13 .

Create a new directory for your project: In a new directory, create a new folder to hold your project files. For example, if you want to create a project called \"hello-typescript\", you would create a folder called \"hello-typescript\".\n3. Create a new package.json file in the root of your project: Open the package.json file in an editor of your choice (e.g., Notepad or VS Code). In the package.json file, add the following content:\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"hello-typescript\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"typescript\": \"^4.7.4\"\n    },\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"start\": \"tsc && node server.ts\"\n    }\n}\n```\n4.

They are translated to machine code when they run, which means that they are slower than compiled languages. However, they have the advantage of being easier to write and edit, as the programmer does not have to worry about the technicalities of compiling the code. Some examples of interpreted languages include Python, Ruby, and PHP.\n\nCompiled languages are programs that are translated into machine code before being executed. They are generally faster than interpreted languages but require more time and effort to write and edit. Some examples of compiled languages include C++, Java, and C#.\n\nJIT (Just-in-time) compiled languages are a hybrid between interpreted and compiled languages. They are translated to machine code when they run, but the translation process happens in a different way from that of compiled languages. JIT-compiled languages offer the best of both worlds, combining the speed and efficiency of compiled languages with the ease of use and flexibility of interpreted languages. Some examples of JIT-compiled languages include JavaScript and .NET.\n\nInterpreted languages offer the following benefits:\n\n1) Easy to write and edit: The programmer does not have to worry about technicalities such as compiling the code, making it easier to write and edit.\n2) Flexible: Interpreted languages are often used for prototyping and experimentation, as they allow for quick changes to the code without having to recompile it.\n3) Widely available: Interpreted languages are often used in web development, as they allow for quick development and deployment of web applications without having to worry about compiling the code.\n\nCompiled languages offer the following benefits:\n1) Fast execution: Compiled languages run faster than interpreted ones as they do not need to be interpreted before execution.\n2) Stability: Compiled languages are less likely to crash or cause unexpected behavior due to runtime errors or bugs in the interpreter.\n3) Portable: Compiled languages can be easily ported across different platforms as they run directly on the underlying platform's hardware without needing an interpreter.\n\nJIT-compiled languages offer the following benefits:\n1) Speed: JIT-compiled languages run at near-native speeds as they do not need to be interpreted first before execution, making them faster than interpreted or compiled alternatives.\n2) Stability: JIT-compiled languages are less likely to crash or cause unexpected behavior due to runtime errors or bugs in the interpreter as the compilation process happens at runtime.\n3) Flexibility: JIT-compiled languages combine the ease of use and flexibility of interpreted ones with the speed and stability of compiled ones, making them ideal for complex applications that require both performance and flexibility.", "finish_reason": "stop", "source": "What is the difference betwean interpreted compiled and JIT-ed programming language, can you also tell me some benefits of each type of language?\nCan you give me at least 3 examples from each of these categories of programming languages?", "secs": 0.1451046877, "source_lang": "eng_Latn", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "id": 434, "eval_reasoning": "The submission provides a clear and complete answer to the task, explaining the differences between interpreted, compiled, and JIT-compiled languages, as well as the benefits of each type.

One of the details mentioned in the article was that \"British schoolchildren have been watching intently as Italian spaghetti trees have been growing steadily on British lawns.\" The report went on to describe how the children were excited to find out that \"spaghetti actually comes from little spaghetti trees which can be grown in British backyards.\"\n\nThe story was widely shared online and became a popular joke among Brits, with many people sharing their own stories about how they had mistakenly thought that spaghetti grew on trees. The popularity of the story led to its inclusion in several later editions of the Weekly World News and other media outlets.\n\nThe legend surrounding the spaghetti trees is often used as an example of how gullible people can be, and how easily they can be misled by false information.
