Here are some suggestions for what you could do/learn in the year leading up to your project start date:\n\n1. Take some online courses: There are many free or low-cost courses available online that cover a wide range of topics related to your field. For example, you could take a course in machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, or statistics. This will give you a chance to learn new skills and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in your field.\n\n2. Work on a project: Why not use the time before your project start date to work on a project of your own? You could develop a new algorithm, build a neural network model, or work on a research project with a local lab or company. This will give you the opportunity to put your knowledge into practice and gain hands-on experience.\n\n3. Attend conferences and workshops: There are many conferences and workshops related to computational neuroscience that take place throughout the year. Attending these events will give you the opportunity to network with other researchers in your field, learn about new developments and techniques, and potentially find collaborators for your project.\n\n4. Prepare for the application process: If you're planning to apply for a PhD program in computational neuroscience in the US, it's important to start preparing early. You could read through research papers in the field, familiarize yourself with the application process at different universities, and start compiling all of the necessary materials (e.g., transcripts, letters of recommendation, personal statement).\"", "translation_meta": {"system_fingerprint": null, "prompt_tokens": 406, "completion_tokens": 301, "cost": 0.001008, "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106"}, "eval_reasoning": "This response is moderately helpful as it provides a clear answer to the user's question about what they could study during the gap year before starting their PhD program.

A first-person controller is a script that controls the movement and actions of a player character in a first-person view. In Godot Engine 3.x, the first-person controller script is typically written in GDScript and applied to the KinematicBody node, which is the equivalent of the Player node in Godot Engine 4.x.\n\nIn Godot Engine 3.x, here's how to use a first-person controller script and apply it to a KinematicBody node:\n\n1. Create a new project in Godot Engine 3.x\n2. Add a KinematicBody node to your scene and give it a name, such as \"Player\"\n3. Add a GDScript file to your project and name it \"PlayerController.gd\"\n4. Add this code to the PlayerController.gd file:\n```gdscript\nextends KinematicBody\n\nvar _movement_speed = 500\nvar _turn_speed = 500\nvar _look_speed = 500\nvar _jump_height = 250\nvar _grounded = false\nvar _direction = Vector2()\nvar _look_dir = Vector2()\nvar _angle = 0\n```\n5. Set up your scene so that the Player node is parented to the KinematicBody node named \"Player\". This will make the Player node the child of the KinematicBody node. You can do this by selecting the Player node in the Scene Editor, then pressing Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac) to select all of its children nodes, then pressing Enter or clicking on the \"Add Parent\" button at the top of the Scene Editor. This will add a parent relationship between the Player node and the KinematicBody node named \"Player\".\n6. Now we need to attach our first-person controller script to this KinematicBody node, so that it can control its movement and actions: To do this, open up your Project Settings window (click on File > Project Settings) and navigate to the Scripting > Global Scripts section. In this section, you should see a list of all of your scripts that are currently being used in your project. Underneath this list, you should see a section called \"Additional Scripts\", which is where you can add new scripts to your project. Simply click on the \"+\" button next to this section and select your PlayerController.gd script from the file explorer window that opens up. This will add your PlayerController script to your project and make it available for use with your KinematicBody node named \"Player\".\n7. Now we can start writing code in our PlayerController script that controls our player character's movement and actions: In our script, we declare some variables that will store information about our player character's movement and actions: The _movement_speed variable stores the speed at which our player character moves when we press left or right on the keyboard (or move the analog stick on a gamepad), while _turn_speed stores the speed at which our player character turns when we press up or down on the keyboard (or move the analog stick on a gamepad). The _look_speed variable stores the speed at which our player character turns their head when we press left or right on the keyboard (or move the analog stick on a gamepad), while _jump_height stores how high our player character jumps when they press spacebar on their keyboard (or tap their jump button on a gamepad). We also declare three additional variables: _direction_, which stores information about where our player character is facing; _look_dir, which stores information about where our player character is looking; and _angle_, which stores information about our player character's current orientation relative to their facing direction (which will be stored in _direction_). These variables will be used later in our code to control how our player character moves and acts based on their direction, look direction, and orientation relative to their facing direction.\n8. Now we can start writing code that moves our player character using their directional input: We start by setting up some variables that store information about our player's movement: We set _movement_speed to 500 (which is equivalent to walking speed), and we set _direction_ to Vector2(0, -1) (which means that when we move forward using WASD or an analog stick, our player will face left). We also set _grounded_to false so that if we fall off an edge or collide with another object while moving forward using WASD or an analog stick, then our player won't be grounded anymore until they stop moving forward using those keys/sticks", "finish_reason": "length", "source": "如何在使用Godot Engine 3.x时，使用GDscript编写第一人称控制器脚本并将其应用于KinematicBody节点？在Godot Engine 4.x中，KinematicBody节点的等效物是什么？第一人称控制器脚本需要如何更改以在Godot Engine 4.x中工作？", "secs": 3.0385951996, "source_lang": "zho_Hans", "system_lang": "eng_Latn", "source_en": "How can you write a first person controller script in GDscript and apply it to a KinematicBody-node when using Godot Engine 3.x and what is the equivalent to the KinematicBody-node in Godot Engine 4.x and how does the first person controller script need to be changed to work in Godot Engine 4.x?", "id": 451, "system_en": "First and foremost, it is important to understand what a first-person controller is. A first-person controller is a script that governs the movement and actions of a player character in a first-person view. In Godot Engine 3.x, the first-person controller script is typically written in GDScript and applied to the KinematicBody node, which is the equivalent of the Player node in Godot Engine 4.x.\n\nIn Godot Engine 3.x, here's how to use a first-person controller script and apply it to a KinematicBody node:\n\n1. Create a new project in Godot Engine 3.x\n2. Add a KinematicBody node to your scene and give it a name, such as \"Player\"\n3. Add a GDScript file to your project and name it \"PlayerController.gd\"\n4. Add this code to the PlayerController.gd file:\n```gdscript\nextends KinematicBody\n\nvar _movement_speed = 500\nvar _turn_speed = 500\nvar _look_speed = 500\nvar _jump_height = 250\nvar _grounded = false\nvar _direction = Vector2()\nvar _look_dir = Vector2()\nvar _angle = 0\n```\n5. Set up your scene so that the Player node is parented to the KinematicBody node named \"Player\". This will make the Player node the child of the KinematicBody node. You can do this by selecting the Player node in the Scene Editor, then pressing Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac) to select all of its children nodes, then pressing Enter or clicking on the \"Add Parent\" button at the top of the Scene Editor. This will add a parent relationship between the Player node and the KinematicBody node named \"Player\".\n6. Now we need to attach our first-person controller script to this KinematicBody node, so that it can control its movement and actions: To do this, open up your Project Settings window (click on File > Project Settings) and navigate to the Scripting > Global Scripts section. In this section, you should see a list of all of your scripts that are currently being used in your project. Underneath this list, you should see a section called \"Additional Scripts\", which is where you can add new scripts to your project. Simply click on the \"+\" button next to this section and select your PlayerController.gd script from the file explorer window that opens up. This will add your PlayerController script to your project and make it available for use with your KinematicBody node named \"Player\".\n7. Now we can start writing code in our PlayerController script that controls our player character's movement and actions: In our script, we declare some variables that will store information about our player character's movement and actions: The _movement_speed variable stores the speed at which our player character moves when we press left or right on the keyboard (or move the analog stick on a gamepad), while _turn_speed stores the speed at which our player character turns when we press up or down on the keyboard (or move the analog stick on a gamepad). The _look_speed variable stores the speed at which our player character turns their head when we press left or right on the keyboard (or move the analog stick on a gamepad), while _jump_height stores how high our player character jumps when they press spacebar on their keyboard (or tap their jump button on a gamepad). We also declare three additional variables: _direction_, which stores information about where our player character is facing; _look_dir, which stores information about where our player character is looking; and _angle_, which stores information about our player character's current orientation relative to their facing direction (which will be stored in _direction_). These variables will be used later in our code to control how our player character moves and acts based on their direction, look direction, and orientation relative to their facing direction.\n8. Now we can start writing code that moves our player character using their directional input: We start by setting up some variables that store information about our player's movement: We set _movement_speed to 500 (which is equivalent to walking speed), and we set _direction_ to Vector2(0, -1) (which means that when we move forward using WASD or an analog stick, our player will face left).

Put 1 liter of beer, 1 kilogram of white meat, 1 kilogram of sausages, 1 kilogram of beef, 1 kilogram of eel (if available), 200 grams of sliced ​​charcoal, 200 grams of herbs, and 50 grams of thistle list (if available) into a large soybean jar, and mix with a small amount of beer. Then let it dry.\n\n2. Put the dried food in water and heat it over high heat. This method can make the food more delicate.\n\n3. Slice the slices into chunks and heat them over high heat. Because this process can make your food more delicate, you need to handle it over low heat. You can also add a small amount of water to make it easier to handle.\n\n4. At this point, you can add charcoal and herbs to promote the fermentation process.\n\n5. When your food becomes more delicate and clear, soak it in a large amount of water and add a small amount of water to make it easier to handle.\n\n6. Now is the time! Turn on the low heat and ignite it. If you want to use a different fire, this is your time!\n\n7. For some people, this may be the most important part!

While the story is creative and maintains a consistent narrative, it falls short in capturing the complexity, depth, and unique voice that is characteristic of DeLillo's writing.\n\nThe language and tone used in the response are simplistic and lack the subtlety and nuance that DeLillo is known for. There is an absence of the distinctive thematic elements, such as existentialism, paranoia, and the exploration of the human condition, that are often found in DeLillo's work. Additionally, the use of clichés, such as \"Once upon a time,\" and phrases like \"spreading the word\" detract from the overall literary quality of the piece.\n\nMoreover, the story primarily focuses on the interactions and adventures of the immortal cats, rather than delving into the deeper complexities of their existence. The aspect of immortality, which is a crucial element of the prompt, is not adequately explored or used to provoke thought or discussion about the implications and consequences of eternal life. The story merely touches upon this concept briefly when discussing the cats' desire to help others in need.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, the response is somewhat relevant to the user's question, as it presents a story about a group of immortal cats living in a New York high-rise co-op. The story is clear and complete, offering a logical sequence of events and a coherent plot. However, it lacks the detail, explanation, and insightful value that would make it a truly helpful response for someone seeking to emulate DeLillo's writing style.\n\nIn conclusion, the response receives a score of 2 because, while it has some relevance to the user's question, it falls short in providing a clear and complete answer that captures the essence of DeLillo's writing style. The response is somewhat helpful but could benefit from greater depth, complexity, and adherence to the specified task requirements.", "eval_score": 2, "eval_meta": {"model_name": "prometheus-eval/prometheus-8x7b-v2.0"}}

He was proficient in martial arts, horseback riding, English, French, and had a deep passion for music, dance, and sports. In his view, everyone should adhere to good moral values and traditions, and demonstrate qualities of elegance, spiritual perfection, decency, and wisdom in life.\n\nAngus Francis deeply respected and admired Anakin Skywalker, considering him a hero and the person he learned the most from. Therefore, he often advised Anakin Skywalker on how to demonstrate his own elegance and upright character in life.\n\nSubsequently, Anakin Skywalker and his companions participated in a public performance in Annas Bay, where they showcased their developed skills in the warrior style. However, this performance also gave Angus Francis some new thoughts and understanding: he realized that his belief in the warrior identity was not derived from its elegance and upright character, but from its association with his self-image. This association made it easier for people to connect themselves with the warrior identity, leading to a relaxation of self-control and loss of rationality.\n\nAs a result, Angus Francis began to rethink his lifestyle and beliefs, realizing that the warrior identity should not be linked to self-image. He also realized that everyone has their own unique personality traits, and good relationships should be built by accepting and understanding these traits equally. From then on, Angus Francis started to relax his self-control and express more emotions.\n\nThis story reflects common themes in the \"Interstellar Legends\" series: mutual understanding, equality, and compassion.

Then, place the apples in the baking dish and spread the filling evenly over them. Top it with the crumble mixture and bake it for about 30 minutes until the crumble is golden brown and the apples are tender.\n\nThere are a few tips and tricks you can use to ensure that your apple crumble turns out perfectly every time. For example, you can bake it in a water bath for extra moisture or use frozen apples for a quick and easy recipe. You can also experiment with different flavors by adding cinnamon, nutmeg, or other spices to the filling.\n\nSo there you have it!
