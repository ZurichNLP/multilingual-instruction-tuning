{"prompt":"### Human: How many times does the average human blink in a lifetime? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.### Assistant:","system":"On average, humans blink about 20,000 times a day, or 10 million times a year. This means that the average person blinks about 30 million times in their lifetime.\n\nThe number of blinks per day varies from person to person and can also be affected by factors such as age, environment, and lifestyle habits. For example, older people tend to blink more slowly and infrequently than younger people, while people who spend a lot of time looking at screens may blink more frequently to help reduce eye strain.\n\nBlinking is a natural reflex that helps keep our eyes moist and functioning properly. When we blink, the eyelids help spread a thin layer of tears across the surface of the eye, which acts as a lubricant and protects against irritants and debris.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how I reached the number 30 million:\n\n1. We can assume that the average person lives for about 75 years (this is an approximation).\n2. Based on the number of blinks per day (about 20,000), we can calculate that a person would blink around 10 million times in a year (365 days).\n3. Multiplying this by the number of years (75), we get a total number of blinks for a lifetime of around 750 million.\n4. Dividing this number by 10 million (the number of blinks per year), we get a total number of blinks for a lifetime of around 75 times 10 million, or around 750 million.","finish_reason":"stop","source":"How many times does the average human blink in a lifetime?

Twitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth?### Assistant:","system":"The minimum upload speed required for streaming at 720p 30fps to Twitch while playing an online videogame depends on several factors, including the quality of the game you are playing, the bandwidth and latency of your internet connection, and the number of players in the game. This is because multiple players sharing the same connection will likely lead to congestion and decreased performance.\n\nAccording to Twitch, the minimum upload speed required for a 720p 30fps stream is around 4,500 Kbps. However, this is just a general guideline and may not be accurate for everyone. To ensure that both your stream and gameplay are smooth, it's recommended to have a higher upload speed than the minimum requirement.\n\nTo estimate how much extra headroom you need, it's important to understand the concept of buffering. When streaming at low speeds, there is a risk that the stream will drop or stutter because the video needs time to buffer before it can be displayed on the screen. Therefore, having more upload speed than needed can help prevent this from happening.\n\nIn general, it's recommended to have at least twice as much upload speed as you need for streaming at 720p 30fps. For example, if you need 4,500 Kbps for streaming, you should aim for an upload speed of at least 9,000 Kbps or higher to ensure a smooth stream and gameplay experience.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a rough estimate and your specific needs may vary depending on your internet connection and hardware capabilities. It's always a good idea to test your setup and adjust accordingly until you find a balance between smooth streaming and smooth gameplay.","finish_reason":"stop","source":"What is the minimum broadband upload speed to stream at 720p 30fps to twitch while playing an online videogame?

Over time, Berlin grew in size and prominence, becoming the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 and later of the German Empire after its unification in 1871. The city experienced rapid growth and development during this period, becoming one of the major industrial and cultural centers of Europe.\n\nThe founding of Berlin as a city can be traced back to its first inhabitants, the Slavic tribes who settled in the area in the 7th century. These tribes were later conquered by the Germans and became part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 13th century, Cölln and Berlin were granted city status by the Margrave of Brandenburg, who also established a market town on the site of today's Alexanderplatz.\n\nThe founding of Berlin as a city is also connected to its location on the Spree River, which served as a key trade route for merchants traveling between eastern and western Europe. The strategic location on this river allowed Berlin to become an important hub for trade and commerce, which contributed to its growth and development over time.\n\nIn short, Berlin was founded by a combination of factors including its strategic location on a key trade route, its proximity to major ports such as Hamburg and Rostock, and its early inhabitants who settled in the area.

{"prompt":"### Human: How do I detail a car?### Assistant:","system":"Details are a way of customizing the appearance of a car to make it unique and personal. The process of detailing typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Washing and cleaning the car: The first step is to wash the car thoroughly to remove dirt, debris, and any other contaminants that may have built up over time. It's important to use a gentle cleanser and not to use harsh chemicals or abrasives, as these can damage the paint and other surfaces.\n\n2. Decontaminating the surface: Once the car is clean, it's important to decontaminate the surface to remove any oils, grease, and other contaminants that may have built up over time. This can be done using a degreaser or other specialized cleaners designed for car surfaces.\n\n3. Polishing: Once the surface is clean, it's time to polish it using a polishing pad or rotary buffer. The goal is to remove any scratches or imperfections from the surface and achieve a high gloss finish.\n\n4. Waxing: After polishing, it's time to apply a protective wax to the car's exterior surfaces. Wax helps protect the paint from UV rays, rain, and other environmental factors that can cause fading and damage over time.\n\n5. Protective coatings: In addition to waxing, it's also important to apply protective coatings such as ceramic coating or sealant to further protect the car's paint from environmental damage. These coatings can be applied by a professional detailer or at home using specialized kits.\n\n6. Final touches: After all of the above steps are complete, it's important to make any final touches to achieve the desired look and feel of the car. This may include adding wheel covers or decals, replacing or cleaning tires, and making any necessary repairs or replacements.\n\nIt's important to note that details are a time-consuming process that requires careful attention to detail and specialized equipment. It may be more cost-effective in some cases to hire a professional detailer who has experience and specialized equipment for this type of work.","finish_reason":"stop","source":"How do I detail a car?","secs":1.3339193463,"source_lang":"eng_Latn","system_lang":"eng_Latn","id":31,"gpt-3.5-turbo-judgement":"Fail","gpt-3.5-turbo-justification":"language","gpt-3.5-turbo-cost":0.0011855}

For example:\n\n```python\n>>> x = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}\n>>> y = [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThe syntax for accessing the values in a set or a list is also different:\n\nIn sets, the values can be accessed using the square brackets and the index of the value, such as `x[0]` for the first value in `x`, or `x[1]` for the second value in `x`. For example:\n```python{7}\n>>> x[0] # prints \"a\"\n>>> x[1] # prints \"b\"\n```\nIn lists, the values can be accessed using the index number, such as `y[0]` for the first value in `y`, or `y[1]` for the second value in `y`. For example:\n```python{7}\n>>> y[0] # prints \"1\"\n>>> y[1] # prints \"2\"\n```\nAlso, sets are unordered collections of unique values, while lists are ordered sequences of values. This means that in a set, you cannot guarantee that the elements will be stored in any particular order, while in a list, you can guarantee that the elements will be stored in a particular order.
